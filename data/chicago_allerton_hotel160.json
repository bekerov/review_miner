{"city": "chicago", "title": "Small ", "text": "Before booking this hotel, I was a little skeptical - I had read several reviews from this website and other sites. I was leaning towards booking another hotel, but a friend of mine, a native Chicagoan, convinced me to book this hotel. I should have trusted my initial instincts. After checking in, I used the &quot;micro-sized&quot; elevator to get to my room. While on the elevator, I spoke with a woman who had previously stayed at this hotel. After commenting on how small the elevator was, she warned me that I just might get a room where I would open the door and run into the bed - I laughed it off not believing her. When I opened the room door, lo and behold, the bed was right there....within three steps of the doorway. The standard room in this hotel is really small. It may be okay for one person, staying for only one night. However, I was staying there for three nights and was not happy about it. Also, there was a foul odor in the hallway on the floor of my room - I contacted the front desk and requested to be moved to a different floor. Also, the standard room does not have a small refrigerator or microwave; however, it does have a micro coffee maker, enough for one cup at a time. On a positive note the hotel is relatively clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.One highlight of this hotel is its location - right on Michigan Avenue (Magnificent Mile), with tons and tons of shopping. If you're thinking about renting a car, think twice and save money. There is plenty of public transportation (buses and taxi cabs)To sum it up: If you don't mind staying in an older hotel with small standard rooms and minimal amenities, by all means stay at the Allerton Hotel.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-09-05"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Beware of their booking system!", "text": "I recently stayed in New York and had originally booked this hotel going by some of the reviews on here, but still a bit sceptical about the room size. This was a personal trip, but I was hoping to use the hotel and add it to my list for accommodating my business clients and staff. Anyway, about a week before my stay I found a much better deal so decided to cancel the booking. I rang the hotel from the airport on way to another trip and everything was sorted (or I so I thought..).I got back after my stay to find an email thanking me for my stay, and asking me to fill in a questionnaire! I checked my credit card and sure enough I've been charged $290 for the first night. So I email the hotel was told blankly that I would not be refunded because I didn't keep the cancellation number (who the hell keeps these anyway). I expected the hotel to send me an email confirming my cancellation but nothing arrived. Like I said I was at the airport and wouldn't be able to check until I returned.So if you have to stay there be careful when making your booking. Who knows what the dodgy booking system might do!Whilst in NY I called into the hotel after reading about the sushi restaurant, obviously before I found that I'd been ripped off. It was very overpriced and there is a much nicer sushi bar a few doors away. The hotel is not actually on Columbus Circle at all, but a side street, and the view is of the back of a high-rise shopping centre. And it's more than a walk to Time Square. There's much better to be had in NY and in the other hotel I had a room on the 37th floor with a view of the Empire State Building for less money.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-06"}

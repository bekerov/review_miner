{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Location Great Service", "text": "I must admit I was a little concerned when reading some of the reviews. We booked the Allerton through Priceline for 5 nights in July. When checking in we were offered a free upgrade to a larger room. I must admit that this &quot;larger&quot; room was still quite small, but this would be expected from an older hotel in downtown Chicago. The key for me is the hotel and the room were exceptionally clean. The staff was friendly and always greated us when we walked in. Parking is quite expensive when using the vallet service. I recommend parking yourself. There is a parking ramp that is $13 cheaper per night a block away. All around a nice place to stay.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-17"}

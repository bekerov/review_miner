{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Not a good place to stay", "text": "This is, by far, the worst hotel we have stayed in in San Francisco. I would not choose to stay there again. Very noisy, stains on the walls, sheets had bugs in them, dust built up everywhere, mold in the bathroom and that is just to start. The best thing I can say is it is close to Union Square, but I would not suggest walking anywhere from that hotel at night. The &quot;free&quot; breakfast was cold cereal and bagels but you got to get there early because they do not restock the food. What they put out is it and when it is gone it is gone.", "hotel": "alexander_inn", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-06-21"}

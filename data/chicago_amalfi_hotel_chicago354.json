{"city": "chicago", "title": "Nice facility average service", "text": "I stayed for one night on business, and loved the location, the room design, and the European breakfast served near the elevators. For the price, the hotel is regal and a good value. However, as someone who is fortunate enough to regularly stay at boutique hotels on business trips, I found the aloof, detached relational-style of the front-desk staff to be a missed opportunity to make this hotel someplace really special. In Chicago, the James (for bigger budgets) or the Burnham (for more modest budgets) are better choices.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-12"}

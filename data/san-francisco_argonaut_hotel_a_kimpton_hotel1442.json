{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Perfect hotel for families", "text": "Enjoyed our recent stay at the Argonaut Hotel - rooms were spacious and very clean. This hotel is in the Cannery, a building that used to be the Del Monte Peach Canning Factory. Desk staff and front door staff were very friendly to my sons. Kids were offered free popsicles in the afternoon, and adults were offered wine during a complimentary happy hour while the kids played on the Wii in the lobby. We loved the leopard and zebra bathrobes! The location is perfect - right near Fisherman's Wharf.Room for improvement - the concierge staff seemed a bit overwhelmed with our simple requests for local tour info. The hotel restaurant (Blue Mermaid) had very slow service and was overpriced.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-17"}

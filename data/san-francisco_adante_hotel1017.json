{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "A Great Value - and Fantastic Location!", "text": "The Adante was ideal for what we needed: decent, clean hotel in centrally located. While the room was modest, it was spotless and certainly bigger than I expected for a twin room. The included continental breakfast is very bare-bones: toast, english muffins, coffee, tea and juice (but not orange). Then again, it's included, so we were grateful to save a few extra bucks each morning. We were in San Francisco during an record-breaking heatwave, so the fact there wasn't air conditioning DID prove challenging. In fact, we asked to be moved from the top floor (7) to a lower floor (4) and it was much cooler. There are ceiling fans in each room. The only real downside was that the hotel seems to have a bit of a youth-hostel vibe: Each night it seemed, partying 20-somethings blasted their boomboxes with their windows and/or doors propped open. We called once to the front desk to ask if they could keep it down, and they quickly addressed the issue. So - all in all - a great stay, I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a clean hotel in a great location -- only 5 minute walk to Union Square. We were very pleased overall! :)", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-19"}

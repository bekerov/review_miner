{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Danger danger!!", "text": "I cannot believe Orbitz has this place listed as 3 stars!!!! based on what standards I'd like to know. There are seedy strip clubs around it, bums and sketchy looking people lurking. The good news is, if you're a druggy and you are looking for used needles- look no further than in front of the garage 2 blocks away from the hotel. To add to the fun- they will print your credit card with the expiration date on your receipt and to keep for their own records which are safely kept out of reach from everyone- not!!!! Way to go Orbitz- I will neveruse you again- dummies.", "hotel": "aida_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-30"}

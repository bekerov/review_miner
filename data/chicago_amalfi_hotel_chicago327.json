{"city": "chicago", "title": "Quirky Hip and Very Nice", "text": "This is not your typical chain hotel. Very hip and trendy furnishings from the unusual sit down with an agent front desk to the trendy quality room furnishings. The Amalfi was very clean, bright and warm. The hallways were bright and well lit. The room was large with quality furniture, a big comfortable bed complimented with plush bedding. The pillows were comfortable. The bathroom was also very large with marble vanity and a large shower with great water pressure. The breakfast was unusual in that they set it up on each and every floor instead of a room on the ground level. The food offered was nothing special, your typical continental fare. The free wireless internet was fast and reliable throughout my stay. This place is a winner and i'd happily return.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-12-15"}

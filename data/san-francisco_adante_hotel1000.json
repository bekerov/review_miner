{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Don't stay there", "text": "The service was non-existent, the breakfast was a joke. There were hardly any seats in the lobby which doubled as a breakfast room and everyone stood around looking ill at ease wondering what to do. There was supposed to be a restaurant opening next door but we never saw any evidence of building work going on. Our room was stifling hot, and the carpet was sticky to walk on. When we checked out, the girl at the desk talked to someone on her mobile phone as she was serving us. It was awful. The only plus is the good location near to Union Square. Next time we will definitely pay more money to stay somewhere better.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-14"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great location and value", "text": "After reading the reviews for this hotel we stayed for a 3 nights in May 2007 and were very pleased. The hotel is centrally located and only a short walk (2 blks) to Union Square. Our room was the Standard Double and at first glance seemed like it was going to be too small but ended up working perfectly. The room was cute and clean, the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was clean, and the front desk staff were amazing!! We used the valet parking service for $28 /day and found it to be a good solution to the parking woes of downtown SF. We never actually made it to the free breakfast or complimentary wine hour but I am sure it would have been a nice perk to take advantage of. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again. One suggestion: if you travel with kids or a lot of luggage you probably want to go with one of the larger (queen) rooms to make your stay more comfortable.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-05-30"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "not worth the price", "text": "The good point is the proximity to Union Square if that is important to you.The rooms are clean enough but small and ugly. No air-conditioning, the view from the rooms not on the street side is depressing. The three days I was there, there was never any butter for breakfast, and muffins were sometimes missing.I asked for a reservation for a door-to-door van to the airport which I paid for but the reception never made the call so I almost missed my flight.No great memories from this hotel. For 95 $ a night, put another 20 and you'll get much more", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-22"}

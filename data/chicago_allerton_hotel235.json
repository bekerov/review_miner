The lobby was full of people. We were told we could &quot;preregister&quot; for a room that would be available in 1/2 hour to an hour. Grumbling, we wandered around nearby shops. When we came back, we had to wait in line until after seven, and were told our room still wasn't ready. No apologies to anyone, everyone was told rooms &quot;become available&quot; at the 3:00 check-in time listed on the web site. After some phone calls to housekeeping, we were told our room lacked only towels and they could let us in. The man at the counter acted like he was doing us a big favor. When we got to our room, the bed wasn't made and I couldn't tell if the bedding was clean or used. I called housekeeping and had to wait another 1/2 hour before showering so they could come fix the bed. The woman from housekeeping was incredibly nice and apologetic--and she was the only staff we met who was. By the time we were able to get out, it was nearly 8:30 and we had missed any prospect of seeing a show, which was the main reason we decided to come to Chicago for the night. When we left, a man who was next to us in line the second time was just getting his room and he was, understandably, furious. The staff were still acting like it was perfectly ok to be checking someone in that late. The room was small and a little shabby but clean. The bed was fantastic. Not sure if I'll use Priceline again for Chicago because I don't want to get stuck here again.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-08-10"}

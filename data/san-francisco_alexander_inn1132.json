{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Absolutly the Pits", "text": "The Alexander Inn, altough near Union Square, is located among several low rent flop houses. The hotel is in disrepair with wall paper peeling, faded and stained carpets, thread-bare towels, doors that won't close easily and an elevator that feels like its going to fail at anytime. The list can go on and on. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and I'll never patronize it again. For my money, SF Chinatown feels a lot safer.", "hotel": "alexander_inn", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-20"}

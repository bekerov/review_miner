{"city": "chicago", "title": "A real find! Service like the Ritz but a fraction of the price!", "text": "My 12 yr old son and I came into town for his first Bears game and i noted from other reviewers to request something special to commemorate this first. Right after we arrived a jr Bears football and a #1 fan glove appeared at our door. Needless to say this was the start of a great stay - any question, the staff handled as if you were a friend staying in theri house... 'i would like to locate a blackberry charger&quot;... the front desk specialist - here, borrow mine - I&quot;m here until 11&quot;. We really felt taken care of in a new large city. The accomodations are first rate, value is terrific and i ditto the other reviewers on the breakfast - nice surprise - again, feeling like you are staying at someone's home. Stay and enjoy. The view and location are not special - but you are right in the middle of things which overrides the immediate surroundings.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-23"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Pleasant experience", "text": "Recently returned from 3 days at the Argonaut Hotel with my adult son. Excellent experience. Rooms were very large, comfortable and nicely appointed. Location is excellent for seeing all San Francisco has to offer. Bike rental is around the corner if you would like to bike over the Golden Gate bridge. Nice wine reception each evening from 5-6 pm. Booked through 1800hotels and got a great rate. Have stayed in San Francisco 6 previous times but this is my favorite hotel of all I've stayed in. Blue Mermaid restaurant has a nice continental breakfast included with the room.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-29"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Excellent return trip to the 6 Columbus!", "text": "I have stayed at the 6 Columbus 2 months ago and decided to book again this hotel because I had liked my experience there. I also booked this time through quikbook, which is the way to get the best rates. I had given it a 4 star last time because I had trouble sleeping 2 of the 4 nights. There were rowdy boys next door and even if I called the front desk, the manager could not get them to quiet down. This time was totally different. I did not hear anything even if I was near the elevator. There are not many rooms per floor so there is less chance of people walking by your room. I booked the queen room this time because there were no pod rooms available but when you are alone, one or the other will do just fine.The staff is simply the best. I arrived at 9:30 in the morning and was given a room right away. Almost all the doormen recognized me and welcomed me back warmly. They treat everyone the same and that is the biggest compliment I can pay them. They don't cater to only the trendy clientele, they cater to everyone..even if you are not a 20something model:)The staff in the restaurant is the same. The manager Quint and the barmen, especially Keith, treat you warmly and I was even offered a nightcap when I stopped by in the evening before heading to my room. It is a great plus for the hotel because you feel like lingering there even if you are on your own. They take great care of you. I would love finding something to complain about because then I could write to the manager and hope for complimentary nights in return, but I can't find anything negative to say about this hotel. I just fear that I will not be able to afford it much longer when their prices will surely go up.d", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-03-11"}

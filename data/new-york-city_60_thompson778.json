I really put some effort in to choosing this hotel for our stay since it was a special occasion. Our room was on the 9th floor on a corner. I though it was pretty small. I expected it to be a little bigger, especially since it was a new building. The bath was small too. The &quot;Fresh&quot; brand toiletries were a surprise since the website advertized &quot;Philosophy&quot; toiletries. Anyway, the shower/tub combo was ok, although the water pressure was great! Sheets were very comfortable. We ordered breakfast via the door knob form one night. In the morning the food arrived and we were still asleep. When they came to pick up the tray an hour later they knocked and we were still asleep. Half awake I agreed when the room service attendant asked if he could heat up our eggs for us. I agreed and he returned a half hour later. I got a surprise when I checked out, he charged us double for the entire meal. So my room service breakfast ended up being $162 dollars. Anyway I wouldn't have agreed to the perceived &quot;re-heat&quot; if I knew I was being charged for a whole new breakfast!Overall, Average to good rating. Room was small for a newly constructed building and the bar on the roof was so small and overcrowded that it was hard to enjoy!!!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-11-06"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great location very friendly good value.", "text": "My daughter and I traveled to San Francisco and wanted to stay at a place that was convenient, safe, clean and affordable. This hotel was perfect. The cable cars are just a few blocks away and the bus stops downstairs. The cafe at street level offers wireless internet and GREAT coffee. The staff was always helpful. If you are not accustomed to street noise you might want to book a room in the rear. We felt it just added to the feel of this wonderful city.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-15"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Quick stay at 6 columbus", "text": "I decided the visit NYC for a friend's party last minute. 6 columbus was offering a rate of $258 (total!), so i decided to check it out.the hotel is located at the southwest corner of central park, directly across the street from the time warner bldg. 5th ave is within walking distance, as well as other typical NYC attractions. it is very conveniently located.The hotel staff were absolutely charming. Everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating. The hotel itself is well designed visually... a sleek and attractive space. My room was a &quot;pod&quot; room. it was quite small, as was expected, but perfectly clean and well designed for its purpose. The bed was very comfy as well. my only critique involves the insulation of the room. I was in room 72, and the wind was quite loud. you could also hear doors opening and closing, etc. I will certainly return to the hotel, but maybe next time i will bring some earplugs. ;)", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-17"}

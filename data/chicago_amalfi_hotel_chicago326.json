{"city": "chicago", "title": "Perfect Location with Great Perks", "text": "My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here at the Amalfi. We checked in on the 23rd of Dec. and are leaving tomorrow morning (Dec. 28). Here are just a few of the highlights:--Steps away from the hustle and bustle of Michigan Avenue, but in a quiet location. We were on the 4th floor and heard very little street noise.--Very friendly staff: we loved that there was a doorman to call taxis and that the &quot;experience designers&quot; were there to give us directions and recommendations if needed.--The managers' reception and continental breakfast: Both were free of charge! In the morning we enjoyed a quick breakfast (yogurt, fruit, bagels, pastries, juice, and coffee). In the evenings we were offered drinks in the lounge and some nice Italian appetizers. The first night there, I asked the bartender if he could make an amaretto sour (the liquor wasn't on the list of available ones), and he went out of his way to find amaretto for me. Everyone here was so friendly and accommodating.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-12-27"}

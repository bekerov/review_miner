{"city": "chicago", "title": "Fantastic stay-great location", "text": "Stayed at the Allerton while in town for a workshop. Staff was friendly and helpful. Location was great for shopping and restaurants. Although the workshop was at the Mercantile Exchange it was great to take the $6 cab ride there and not have so very much noise at night yet right in the middle of everything. The rooms were comfortable and the beds and linens were clean and comfy. The bathroom is on the smallish side so be careful getting out of the shower because you ste right into the toilet. Room was cleaned every day. I would stay there again on a personal trip and recommend it highly to anyone going in the future.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-21"}

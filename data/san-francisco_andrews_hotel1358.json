{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Still love the Andrews", "text": "I have stayed at the Andrews from time to time since the late 1980s and continue to be charmed by the place. Granted you have to like European style hotels and the rooms are small, but the staff is pleasant and helpful. In addition the breakfast delivered to the floor every morning and the glass of wine every evening in Fino are wonderful extras and the price is right. We ate at the bar in Fino's twice -- great Caesar salads. We'll be back.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-03-17"}

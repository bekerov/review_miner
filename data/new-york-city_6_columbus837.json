{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Amazing Stay (And yes the doormen are hot!)", "text": "I booked the hotel through Quickbook at a rate of $127 for Fri/Sat and $90 for Sun. There were no problems with the booking, and I would throughly recommend Quikbook as a third party agent.Upon checkin I was given a free upgrade from standard queen to supeior (or deluxe - not sure which it is). The doormen make you feel very special, and could not do more to help. (As others have said they are all pretty hot too!!) :) I didn't really find the noise of the aircon too loud, the view was of some non-descript building and some shafts, but that didn't bother me. The only minor negatives I can think of (and I'm having to think hard) were that the ipod docking station wasn't dusted down and the bed frame sticks out a little, so I banged my leg a few times! For the rate I got, these are such small things that it really means nothing compared to the fantastic service, and great clean rooms at the 6 Columbus. Location, quality and genuine warmth and hospitality from the staff here makes this place exactly what it is: a PERFECT little hotel for any traveller to New York City.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-21"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Value +", "text": "The guides and user comments are pretty accurate for this one. Rooms are a great value. They are on the small side but we didn't go to SF to sit in our room. Going for the petit suite gave us a bit more room. Great service especially from the assistant manager ... Oscar. Friendly and helpful. Be ready though, street facing rooms are loud. Single pane windows do very little to block street noises which ranges from annoying to absolutely hilarious.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-23"}

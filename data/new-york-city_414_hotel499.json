{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "charming european-style hotel experience", "text": "We enjoyed our stay at the 414 very much. The lobby is simple, attractive and welcoming. The small interior courtyard is lovely. Our room overlooked it, and we were able to open our window at night and hear birdsong in the morning...in the middle of New York City! Our room was comfortable, and the bath was clean and updated. the headboard on the bed was a bit stained and dirty-looking; that really should be very clean, since it affects one's impression of overall cleanliness. That was our only complaint. the staff were very friendly; the feeling was of a small, independent European hotel.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-26"}

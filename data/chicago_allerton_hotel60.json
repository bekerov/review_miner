{"city": "chicago", "title": "Nail Clippins in bed to fluid stains on chairs uck never again", "text": "I have traveled in large cities like NYC, LA, SF and have stayed at a wide range of Hotels and have experienced a wide range from good to bad in service and the type of rooms. I have to say this place takes the cake on not looking nearly as nice as the pictures on their web site. They say they had a complete renovation in July of 08, ok not even a year ago. Then why was the furniture in our room busted stained with god knows what and the shower caulking was peeling and falling into the shower and floor. The sink and toilet had stains like rust on floor and around the faucets. The carpet in the room was thread bear with rips and holes in the middle of the room. The walls in the halls are scratched busted wood trims filthy looking doors etc. All of this combines to make a so called &quot;nice&quot; hotel have the appearence of a dump. For the prices they list you can find MUCH MUCH BETTER elsewhere. I have pics and will post them later. If you are use to staying at cheap roadside hotels then this is your place you might think its a palace. But trust me its not. Plus the staff was rude and not helpful from the doorman that ignored us on entry with our bags to the bar tender that took the cake or rude. I would say stay away from this Hotel. Oh we also had nail clippings in our bed sheets and the towels left a layer of linen like dust all over my body and in our hair. Its riduculous that I coudlnt take a shower and dry off with a towel without being covered in a layer of white lint. Plus on check in we asked for a room with a view they had plenty she said on entry, we thought cool how lucky, then upon entry to our room our view was of a fire escape.. nice job lady. Sure she had a good laugh about that with her co-worker (slackers) .", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-21"}

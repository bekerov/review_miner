We were on 3 and had a sleepless first night. Staff moved us the next day. Also be aware that the heat isn't turned on unless it drops below 45 degrees (friendly staff shared this with us.) When we asked for heat, they brought a space heater. Cozt rest of stay - so both problems corrected.Would stay again if I had business in Midtown nearby. Wouldn't be my first choice.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-19"}

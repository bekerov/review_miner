{"city": "chicago", "title": "A Rip Off Like No Other", "text": "My advice - STAY AWAY.The hotel itself is &quot;OK&quot; - rooms are average, location, pretty good, service, OK as well.But here is my most recent experience. I booked a room for one night in July, &quot;guaranteed,&quot; through Orbitz, and arrived for check in to learn that the hotel had &quot;overbooked.&quot;The front desk clerk asked whether I would consent to taking a complimentary room at a hotel 8 blocks away, PLUS a refund of the $ I had paid for the room at the Allerton - meaning in essence, a night free.It was a hot July evening and against my better judgment after a long day on the road, but I accepted - schlepped my bags the 8 blocks.At least I had the good sense to take the name of the clerk and the Director of Sales . . . the former had assured me that the refund would appear on my credit card &quot;within a couple of days&quot; - which of course, it did not.So I contacted the DOS via email and he assured me he would follow up with Orbitz, which who knows if he did . . . but I told him that truly, this was not Orbitz's responsibility: Orbitz did its job. It was the hotel that overbooked its rooms and then made me an offer it did not live up to.Suffice it to say, there has been no refund of the $187+, and I will never stay at the Allerton again, and recommend that no one reading this stay there either. We have come to expect these shenanigans from the airlines, but I thought hotels were better run businesses that actually cared more about their customers and reputations. Usually, that is true. Not in the case of the Allerton.Michael from NJ", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-12"}

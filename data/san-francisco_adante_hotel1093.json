{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Not that cheap not that nice", "text": "We stayed at the Adante for about $80 after taxes in an attempt to save money. The building itself is sort of musty, and the rooms are not much better. Bad carpet, unkempt bathrooms, and worst of all, bed bugs. Staff was fine. Did not use the cafe/bar but it did not look like much. Very much a hostel environment. &quot;Free breakfast&quot; consists of meager coffee and croissants. Do not recommend unless you bring your own sheets and are really strapped for cash.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-06-20"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Quirky charm and very good value", "text": "We booked a regular room but had a corner room with a separate bedroom and sitting area so had plenty of space. The room was very comfortable and the window which opened in the bathroom was great on a sunny day. Location was great and the noise level from the street was tolerable. Breakfast was delicious and conveniently located just in the hall outside the room. Staff was especially helpful and friendly. Little quirks like the unsual to operate elevator added to the charm and the value was great.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-04-29"}

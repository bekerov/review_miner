{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "I want to go back!", "text": "Stayed in this hotel for only one night, and I wish I could have stayed longer (for the same price, of course). We booked through priceline and got an AMAZING deal. The hotel is a little bit hard to find, the taxi driver could not find it, and took us around and we ended up paying more fare. But it's in a great location: Central park is right across the street and Times Square can be reached by walking down Broadway. There is a shopping center right across the street, but we did not have a chance to check it out. We stayed in the pod room, which is super tiny, but extremely clean and decorated really well. Even though the bed is a bit small for two people, it is really comfortable because of the pillow top mattress. The flat screen tv was great, but I would have liked to have maybe a little table or at least a chair to put things on, I think there would have been enough room for a least a chair or a luggage holder. I loved the bathroom, it was very modern and pretty. Toiletries, Q-tips and cotton balls. There was a safe in the closet, a bathrobe and an umbrella to use during your stay. I was disappointed though because there was no hairdryer. The AC in the room worked really well. The staff was great. I would recommend it to everyone and would definitely stay there again.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-18"}

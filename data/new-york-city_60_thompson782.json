{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Down on 60 Thompson", "text": "Great Location, cool rooms then it all goes downhill from there. If you want any attention from the front desk staff do not stay at 60 Thompson. If you want to control your room temperature do not stay at 60 Thompson. If you want a hotel that listens to their guest when there are problems... do not stay at 60 Thompson. Our room was about 95 degrees and could not cool down (it was a November stay). We were told to open our window--ever stay in a NY hotel room with an open windw? Might as well sleep on the street. The front desk staff could not care less about the issue (nor the same problem when the person in front of us on the checkout line complained about the same problem). Even a letter to the hotel manager met with no repsonse. The bar is cool and the staff at the door are nice, but you are better served at the Mercer, Soho/Tribecca Grand or any of the W Hotels where they actually care about giving you a good stay.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-09-30"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Lets be fair here", "text": "I was happy with my stay at the Adante. Small rooms? Sure, but most European Style Hotels have smaller rooms. Despite the claims of paper thin walls I heard nothing from my neighbors in my whole stay. Sketchy neighborhood? Not really. I traveled alone and I never felt unsafe. However I did take a cab late (After Midnight) at night as to not be waiting at or walking from bus stops alone. During the day its perfectly fine. Going west of that block while alone, at night might not be ideal, but walking to and from Union Square is not big deal.  Remember what you are paying in comparision to the other on shared bathroom hotels in the area. it isn't a five star and it doesn't bill itself as such. These are all things one needs to keep in mind. My only complaint if you can even call it that is that housekeeping makes it rounds rather early. My advice is if you go out to enjoy the night life, make sure you put your DND sign up before crawling into bed. The staff has always been super helpful and nice. Even before my stay I called with questions, and they were very happy to answer them. They helped me figure out MUNi route and find bus stops and other little things that made my stay much better. I am returning to the Adante next month and I am looking forward to another positive experience.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-09-26"}

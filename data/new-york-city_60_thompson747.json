{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Fantastic hotel great location!", "text": "My husband and I just returned from a long weekend in New York and a fantastic stay at 60 Thompson, I can't rate it highly enough! The staff were great and very helpful, and our room was fantastic, and ready for us when we arrived on Thursday morning. We had dinner at Kittichai on our first night (try the chocolate ribs!) which was delicious. We had never been to NY before and the location of the hotel was so perfect, close to all the great shops and some fantastic restaurants. We can't wait to go back to 60 Thompson and are hoping to make it an annual event, we really wouldn't consider staying anywhere else!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-03-28"}

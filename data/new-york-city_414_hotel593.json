{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Location Location Location", "text": "Located on Restaurant Row and near the major theaters, this boutique hotel has nicely furnished rooms (new plasma TV's)at an incredibly good price. Mike at the front desk is exceptionally helpful with restaurants and touring. Heater controls were hard to locate and there was little info available on use of phones, etc. but these were small oversights for such a comfortable stay. We had three rooms for five days (in both of the hotel's two buildings) and everyone was content. Would return in a minute.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-04-01"}

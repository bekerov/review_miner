{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Hotel", "text": "We stayed in the 6 Columbus Hotel for 5 nights in March 2008 for St Patrick's weekend. Overall it's a great hotel which I would recommend. The hotel is located opposite the Time Warner building just at the bottom of Central Park, we walked nearly everywhere, it was in such a convenienct location. The staff were very friendly and helpful, check in was fine, our room wasn't ready, but we were offered complimentary drinks in the hotel bar while we waited.We had booked a 'Pod' room, however on checking in we were advised we had been upgraded to the next biggest room. Accommodation was lovely, very modern, with plasma TV, ipod docking station and minibar. We got a complimentary paper everyday and the room was cleaned daily also. We didn't eat at all in the hotel, but the restaurant always looked busy and the hotel has a nice little bar for those apres shopping drinks!!All in all I would recommend this hotel. The rooms are quite small, but hey, this is New York city, you're there to shop and to party, not sit in your room all day. Special mention to all the gang next door in The Coliseum pub, hi guys!!", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-04"}

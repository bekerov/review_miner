{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great service at the Amalfi!", "text": "The Amalfi is an upscale hotel with an upscale staff. When you first walk in the modern chic lobby, your nose is greeted with a fresh floral aroma. The staff is friendly and dilligent, and the rooms are devine. The amenities are great, with a breakfast bar on each floor you don't have to change out of your p.j's. You can walk right out of your room to the continental breakfast. The location is in the heart beat of Chicago. I recommend this hotel.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-03-25"}

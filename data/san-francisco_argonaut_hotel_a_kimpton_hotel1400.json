{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Nice locations cold shower", "text": "Good location: opposite to Maritime National Historical Park and next to the Cable Cars. Nice spacious room, good bed, large bathroom. BIG disadvantage: COLD shower. Not only in the morning at 'rushhour', but also late at night. So there seems to be a problem with the hot water supply.We didn't have breakfast at the restaurant, but there is plenty to choose from in walking distance. Valet parking is very expensive (43 dollar p/n). When you become a Kimpton member (for free via their internetsite) you can book a pakkage with parking. Then parking is only 1 dollar p/n.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-01"}

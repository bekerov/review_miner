{"city": "chicago", "title": "Fantastic stay at the Amalfi Hotel! I'll be back!", "text": "I was in Chicago for business recently and stayed at the Amalfi Hotel. The price was comparable to other hotels in the area and the location was excellent for me. I read a recent negative review of the hotel and I completely disagree. This hotel may not be right for everyone. It is very modern, which some may not &quot;get&quot;. I loved the way the room was decorated with the rich red color. The bed was very comfortableand I slept well. The bathroom was very nicely decorated and had a duel head shower and nice smelling Aveda products. I had free wireless internet too. Many hotels make you pay a fee, but not at the Amalfi. Besides that, there is a business center with two computers and a printer which came in handy for me since I had to print some last minute documents for my meeting. The hotel also included a complimentary breakfast on each floor, which was very convenient. The coffee and fruit was delicious. The muffin I had was &quot;ok&quot;. The hotel staff was extremely helpful and always willing to assist me. I made some requests and had questions during my stay and they were always polite and professional. Thanks George and the rest of the friendly staff!I completely enjoyed my stay and I'll be back the next time I visit Chicago on vacation!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-23"}

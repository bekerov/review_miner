{"city": "chicago", "title": "Not a bad place at all", "text": "I recently stayed at the Hotel Allerton for a conference (10/22-10/26). It was a decent deal that I got through the conference. I had read previous reviews that were mixed regarding this hotel and was sort of skeptical. I will break down my review for you now...Hotel/Room: The hotel is old/historical looking from the outside. But it has been recently refurbished. Other reviews stated that the elevator only went to the lobby and you needed to transfer out. This has all changed. You can now ride the elevator from street level to your room. I had a room on the 19th floor. It was on the small side (had two beds) but was tastefully decorated. The TV was kind of awkward because it was perpendicular to the beds. We faced another building (but I didn't care for a view). The bathroom was nicely decorated and the shower had great water pressure. No fridge in the room but a desk in between the beds. Small closet with a safe.Location: This was one of the best features. Right on Michigan Ave. A couple blocks away from everything including: Giordano's Pizza, Water tower mall, John Hancok, and a bunch of other great shopping stores. You could walk to pretty much anything.Service: I had booked for 1 king bed but at the last minute needed two beds. The hotel stated that they were sold out and couldn't make the change. However when I got there, they were able to give me the two beds and didn't even charge me extra. The bellmen were nice enough. And I thought the front desk was great too. They were going to charge me for internet access, however I checked my wireless and found that I could pick up a signal free of charge. Never used room service. Maid service was good. No turn down though.I really had no complaints about this hotel. I got what I expected and was pleased with it. Would go back if I needed to.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-30"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "a gem!...", "text": "Just had a quick trip to NYC, busy with appointments, rendezvous and shopping....found 60 Thompson to be a wonderful oasis. It has a calm and quiet feel in a bustling neighbourhood, with great restaurants and shops in abundance just steps away...love the area!The staff, fom beginning to end were friendly, helpful and ever-smiling.....didn't see a bit of the &quot;too cool&quot; commented on in another review.We were more than pleasantly surpised by an upgrade to a luxurious suite, with a terrace with breathtaking views....I can't comment on other rooms/sizes etc..... but must say that this was beautifully appointed,spare but comfortable. I would assume that all bathrooms have the same lovely products, good and plentiful towels, thick robes....bed linens by Frette. There were gorgeous fresh flowers throughout the suite....and I saw a cart in the hallway,filled with vases of fresh orchids, making deliveries to other rooms.Room service was prompt on one occasion and rather slow on another, but staff were extremely apologetic....busy breakfast hour. The appetizers available from their restaurant were delicious,unusual and arrived piping hot and nicely presented....breakfast was more on the ordinary side, but fresh and again nicely presented.I'd happily stay here again!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-11-03"}

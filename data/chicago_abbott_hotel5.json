The crazy woman who answer the phone YELLED at me, &quot;WE DON&quot;T DISCUSS PRICES OVER THE PHONE&quot; and then hung up on me!!! Never have I been treated so rudely by anyone at a hotel. I was so confused afterwards that I decided to call back and ask, &quot;was it really necessary to hang up on me?&quot; and she continued yelling. This place clearly has no idea how to treat potential customers but did a fine job of scarring this one away. NO THANK YOU! Luckily my only interaction with them was a phone call.", "hotel": "abbott_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-05-03"}

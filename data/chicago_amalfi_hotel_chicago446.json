{"city": "chicago", "title": "Best Hotel Ever.", "text": "I ended up at the Amalfi on a last minute deal, staying at the hotel for aruond $130 which is beyond a value. Here is what you should know about the hotel:Fantastic location with incredible rooms - clean, comfortable beds, double headed shower with great water pressure, Aveda products, fantastic channel choices and quiet.I am one of those traveler's who feels the need to disinfect a room as soon as I get there -- toilet, shower, remote control, phone -- and for the firs time ever, I didn't feel it was necessary.On top of the greatness that the Amalfi is, there is a free breakfast every morning (on each individual floor) as well as free cocktail hour in the early evening. Lastly, the concierege and basically anyone working at the hotel are so friendly, kind and informative. Is there anything wrong with the hotel? If you consider bad music playing in the lobby (think Scorpions, Cyndi Lauper) then that is the only downfall because honestly the lack of height (only 6 floors) is an afterthought after you stay at this hotel.We love Chicago but our experience at the Amalfi made the trip much more enjoyable.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-01-17"}

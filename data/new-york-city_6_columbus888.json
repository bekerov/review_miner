{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Location", "text": "We stayed at the hotel because we had reservations for dinner at Per Se. The location can't be beat - it was across the street from the Time Warner Center. The employees were very courteous. There is a Duane Reade (or Rite Aide or similar drugstore) right next door in case you need something the hotel doesn't provide. When we checked in they said they were upgrading us to a King Deluxe, but the bed was not a king. Not a problem since the room was not too small. We were too exhausted to complain. Bathroom is decent with heated floors (but only half the floor was heated, by the sink but not in front of toilet or shower/bath). Fresh bath products. Turndown service at night. Inner rooms look out onto rooftop or shaft area. Loud AC unit from nearby buildings may keep you up at night if you are a light sleeper. Subway stop across the street. Whole Food Market in the TW Center has a great food court for a snack to go. Right next to Central Park.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-03-30"}

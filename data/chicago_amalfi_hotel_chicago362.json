{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Hotel", "text": "This was my 10th time in Chicago always staying at the &quot;big name&quot; hotels on the Mag mile so I was a little apprehensive about choosing this hotel. (mainly chose it based on cost). My fears were unfounded. I loved this hotel. The breakfast spread on each floor was amazing. I thought it would be a couple of donuts and some coffee but was pleasantly surprised. Bottled juices, varieties of coffee, various teas, jellies, pastries, muffins, cereals, everything but bacon and eggs ! Nice touch. And the evening happy hour was great. Again I expected some chips and pretzels and draft beer. Instead, there were olives, cheeses, various breads, arichokes, brueshetta and many high-end items. And they had bottled beers (two varieties) and wine and liquers. They could use a little bigger lounge as the seating was limited, but I loaded up and went back to my room. The room was fine. All of the usual amenities. The only negative I could mention was the view was pretty crappy. But I'm used to the Hyatt or Sheraton and the rest on the Mag mile which have views that you pay for. Since I'm not really a person that stays in the room, it wasn't a big deal. The place is very close to the El and everything else. I'd not hesitate to stay here again. Especially if you get a great deal like I did.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-11"}

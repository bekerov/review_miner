{"city": "chicago", "title": "Enjoyed the Allerton / perfect location", "text": "My son (20 yr old) and I visited Chicago from 31Jul - 06Aug 07 and stayed at the Allerton. We had a lovely room (two double beds). We found it very clean, comfortable and quiet. The staff were efficient, and Karen (tho busy) was so helpful when booking tours (we found a little Theatre by the lake and went to see Oklahoma...excellent). We loved Chicago, a beautiful City so much to see and do, and we did as much as we could. The location of the Allerton is just perfect, 3 steps from Michigan Ave and all that wonderful shopping. Would have no hesitation in recommending the Allerton to anyone. If I had to make one negative remark, it would be that the elevator could be slow to arrive. But both my son and I had a terrific stay at this hotel, and if I was returning to Chicago, would be delighted to stay at there again. Well done Allerton!!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-15"}

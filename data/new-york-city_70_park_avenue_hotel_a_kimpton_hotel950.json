{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Unexpected gem steps from Grand Central", "text": "Found an incredible deal through Travelzoo and booked it even though I didn't know much about it. Much to my relief, my experience mirrors the better reviews here and I had a wonderful stay.First off, follow the advice of other reviewers here and sign up for the Kimpton rewards program. I got free wifi, a $15 mini-bar credit and even a room upgrade. (It was January, so I doubt they can do this in high season.) I got a corner room and was worried about the noise from the street like others have mentioned but I didn't notice it at all. What I did notice was that my room was beautiful! Seriously, most hotel rooms look alike, but this room had character. Beautiful and understated elements, huge bed with cozy bedding. The tv's at an odd angle but it worked.The bathroom was quite nice but had one very strange feature: the toilet was put in almost flush with the wall. So, you almost had to sit at an angle. I know space is tight in NY but that's a little ridiculous. Other than that it was a pretty great bathroom with good amenities from L'Occitaine. And bonus: they delivered the Sunday NY Times to my door. Fabulous!I didn't spend any time in the lobby area, which was much smaller that I expected, but there did seem to be computers set up for people to use. The front desk staff was helpful when I checked in and out, but returning later in the evenings I just got unhappy glances rather than a hello. Kind of strange.As for the location, you're 4 very short blocks to Grand Central and the bus to JFK is right there. Couldn't be better situated, really, since you're close to transportation yet not in a touristy, crowded area.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-24"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Make sure to get a good room by calling ahead", "text": "We booked this as a last minute getaway on Priceline over Labor Day, for $110/night and we were quite happy with our experience. Based on the decidedly mixed reviews we had read, we called ahead of time and were able to secure one non smoking room with a queen bed and one with a king. Yes, the rooms are not huge. But they are perfectly adequate and the beds, cleanliness, etc. were fine. We actually had a room quite close to the elevators, on the 9th floor, but were not bothered by noise. The location is fantastic. We did have to wait once about 10 minutes for the second set of elevators, but a service call to fix a plugged shower was dealt with promptly and check-in/check-out was smooth and efficient. Just be sure to call ahead so you get a good room,", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-09-08"}

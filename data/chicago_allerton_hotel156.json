{"city": "chicago", "title": "I stay there often on business - so-so", "text": "My company has a discounted rate with the Allerton, so I stay there once or twice a month, and I most recently stayed there late Sept 2007. Some comments:-Like other posters on this site, I agree that the hotel is a bit outdated, but I have never had an issue it not being clean. Room size is also adequate for Chicago, esp considering the fantastic location. However, bathroom setup is usually inconvenient, with little &quot;vanity&quot; or counter space.-I frequently have an issue here with &quot;smoking&quot; vs &quot;nonsmoking&quot; rooms. Seventy-five percent of the time, I check into my supposedly nonsmoking room only to find it smells of smoke. The front desk is usually apologetic, and they quickly assign me to a new (very fresh smelling) room, but it is quite annoying to have to go through those motions. It makes me wonder - why can't they assign me the nonsmoking, &quot;fresh-smelling&quot; room to begin with? -Do not bother with the restaurant/bar with all of the other great Chicago places so close...-As someone else mentioned, you have to take an elevator to the 3rd floor to check in, and then take a different elevator to your room. This becomes a pain when you want to leave the hotel, as you must take the elevator to the 3rd floor, and then switch to a different elevator to reach street level. The always friendly bellman told me last week that apparently beginning in October, 2007, you'll be able to take the elevator from your room right down to ground level, which would eliminate the elevator transfer, and save the hassle. Hopefully he's right! -The fitness room is interesting - on the top floor, which supposedly was the old &quot;Tip Top Lounge&quot;. Even though the view is interesting during a workout, I always wonder how cool the Tip Top Lounge must've been in its day?", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-01"}

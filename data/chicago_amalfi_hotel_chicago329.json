{"city": "chicago", "title": "Enjoyed the Amalfi", "text": "My wife and I just returned from three days in Chicago. We stayed at the Amalfi Hotel and would highly recommend it. The staff were all very professional, courteous and helpful. The hotel is clean and well-kept. The continental breakfast and evening reception are also a bonus. The hotel is in a great location a block off Michigan Ave. and just a few blocks from River North. It's also easily accessible via public transportation. We would definitely return to the Amalfi on future trips to Chicago.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-18"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Enjoyed stay at 414", "text": "My wife and I stayed here for seven nights from November 22. We were given a room on the top floor. The room was well decorated but it was cold. After complaining about the cold I was told the heating would be turned on. Later the same day, no heating. I complained and another guest also complained. Heating was provided. After this bad start I found the 414 to be just right for our stay . The breakfast was adequate, free internet was provided and the staff were OK. The bathroom was fine, with a good shower but little enough water for a good bath. The location is ideal. I would stay there again", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-12-26"}

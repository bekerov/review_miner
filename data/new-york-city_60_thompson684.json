{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Good but perhaps not as good as their prices promise", "text": "We stayed at 60 Thompson in April and had a perfect stay there. We were re-bookend into this hotel as the hotel we originally chose had to close their doors for a short time.When we first got there, we immediately liked the lobby and it was nice to get a coffee with pastry there every morning before starting a new day in that great cityNice room, big enough, just redecorated so everything nice and new, perfect bathroom and we slept wonderfully. Extraordinary, to be able to sleep so well in a city that never sleeps. The only noise we heard was our neighbour coming ' home' .Can't rave about the staff, they where average in my opinion, they did their job and nothing more than that.During our stay, there were still some renovations going on, so neither bar nor restaurant was open. We did get the rooms at about a third of the going rate, probably due to the rebooking and of course because not everything was ready. I imagine the bar and restaurant to be really something, but I don't think that ' extra experience' is worth $600 or more.We enjoyed our stay very much but it is definitely out of our range now.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-29"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Loved San Francisco AND the Andrews Hotel", "text": "Asked for a quiet room (thanks to Tripadvisor reviews) and got that with room 305 (queen). Small but comfortable. Very good value for money compared to the other hotels we found. Union Square area is definitely your best choice if you want to be close to everything. Stayed for 3 nights beginning + 3 nights end of our trip. Hair dryer was not present in room but could be obtained at simple request. Service impeccable and very friendly. Bathroom was somewhat old and small but very clean (wonderful soap and shampoo!). Bed cosy and very comfortable. Pigeons and neighbours could be heard on occasion but these are really minor/negligeable remarks. Overall : super value for money. Only disadvantage and very unusual sight for Europeans (in my opinion) were the large number of homeless people in the Union Square area. Complimentary breakfast s a very nice touch although we started to become boared with it towards the end. Good coffee ! (also available 24 hrs in the lobby).", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-09-15"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Nice But Not Special", "text": "This is a very average Loop/Michigan Ave./River area hotel.Rooms were modern and clean, as you would expect. Prices were very high-- also expected. Views are unimpresive, but the location is good. The morning spread of food they put out is excellent.In all it was a nice place to stay but I don't understand the high praise of the other reviews. Nothing special here. It is a bit gimmicky and attempts to be ultra hip. No counter to check-in at, you sit at a desk with an &quot;experience designer&quot; who then does the exact same thing that every clerk at every other hotel does. Web site doesn't tell you, but there is parking on site ($37 per night).In all it was fine and I would stay here again, but I don't agree with the hype of the other reviews.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-04-26"}

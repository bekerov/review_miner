Was disappointed - room was small (though typical of an NYC hotel room), amenities were limited, bed was just OK. Teh worst part, however, was how noisy the hotel was: the bar at reception was cranking music until 3am on a Wednesday night... The toilet flush was like the Hoover Dam unloading... And worst of all, teh bottom of my door wasn't very well sealed off, so hallway noise (and - yuk - secondhand smoke!) intruded all night.I slept from 3am until 6. I figure it was $150 an hour.

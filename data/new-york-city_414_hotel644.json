We felt like we were living in a college dorm with people slamming doors, laughing, stomping their feet going up and down the stairs, at all hours of the night. These people belong in large hotels. Perhaps &quot;quiet please&quot; signs in the halls would help.We were also concerned about being asked for our driver's licenses upon checking in, even though we prepaid and provided a credit card for incidentals. They were photocopied. With all the identity theft going on these days, this was a little disconcerting.We would probably pass on another stay.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-12-20"}

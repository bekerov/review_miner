{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Loved It!! HIghly Recommended", "text": "OK so - NYC is a tricky place to find a hotel. I was there for a Fashion tradeshow, so I needed to be somewhat close to the Javitz. When on the phone, they were extremely polite... they had to upgrade us to a nicer room b/c they didn't have any 2 twin rooms left (fine with me!). We got a big room (esp. for NYC) near the courtyard, which ended up being very quiet and peaceful. The staff was sooooo nice and helpful, and the property seems very safe. I have told everyone I know who travels to NYC about this hidden little secret. Highly recommended!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-01-10"}

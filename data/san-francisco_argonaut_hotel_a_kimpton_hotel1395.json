Ghardelli square and Pier 39 are just a short walk away. The service and condition of the hotel was superb. They have free wine in the lobby from 5 to 6 each night, which was nice. There is plenty to do within a short walk of this hotel. I hightly recommend it, great stay!..", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-08"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Very Nice Stay", "text": "Stayed here for 6 nights at the start of our holiday. Ideal location and is literally a 5 minute walk to Union Square and all the main shops. We were very impressed and booked for 2 nights at the end of our holiday.Our first stay was a back room which was a nice size and quiet. This was a special occasion which we mentioned when booking online and a bottle of champagne awaited us on arrival. The breakfast on each floor is simple but nice. The staff are friendly and helpful.The complimentary glass of wine in the cosy hotel bar is a nice touch. We ate once in the restaurant and it was excellent.Our second stay was a suite situated at the front of the hotel overlooking the main street. The fan in this room was not working which made it extremely hot and we found it very noisy. We would definitely recommend a back room.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-03"}

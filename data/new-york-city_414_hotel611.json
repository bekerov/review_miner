{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Location Excellent Personal Service Good Value", "text": "This was our first trip to New York in many years. We were travelling with friends who selected this hotel due to the low cost and the location to Times Square and Restaurant Row. We found the hotel staff very professional and efficient. They really took great care of us and make us all feel very welcome. Mike especially was most helpful and really made our stay a memorable experience. He was even able to obtain reservations for us on Saturday night at a very popular restaurant on restaurant row. Really a nice feat and we had a wonderful time. The TV could use a few more channels, I had difficulty in picking up the local CBS station which was a little frustrating since it is only a few blocks away. However, we were not in NY to watch TV. We found the rooms to be efficient, clean and more than adequate for the time we spent there. The breakfast left a little to be desired as the pastries seemed to be a little old. However, the coffee and juice selection was good and there are plenty of places to eat within a couple of blocks. We will most likely stay there again for future visits. This place is small and does book up pretty quickly.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-11-05"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Beautiful hotel shame about the service.", "text": "We stayed here for a one night stop over before catching a flight to NYC the following day. The hotel was fantastic, the room was big, with a separate lounge area, great bathroom with big shower and two big televisions. Eventhough we had spent the previous 36 hours on a train, the bed was sooooo comfy! The only thing wrong with the room was that either i couldn't find a safe or there wasn't one. If i was staying there longer than one night i would want a safe in my room. Location was spot on, we walked everywhere the evening we visited. The service at the front desk, not so good. We went to enquire about a shuttle to the airport for the next morning on our way out to dinner, the lady gave us the phone number, explained very badly what we needed to do in order to arrange it and then instead of offering the phone to us or calling for us, we were made to take the trip back up to the 9th floor to make the call! I wasn't particularly impressed with that, especially as the hotel itself wasn't a cheap one to stay in.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-17"}

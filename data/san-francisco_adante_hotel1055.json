{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "And it's close to Dottie's True Blue Cafe", "text": "Just what I was looking for. A comfortable, inexpensive place to hang out for a long weekend. The front desk clerk was very helpful, quickly finding me a nonsmoking room despite my early arrival. The room was clean and everything worked: the towels were clean and soft, there was plenty of hot water, the tub drained quickly, the lights didn't flicker and the TV and remote worked fine. For the price I paid ($54/night via Expedia) I don't take these things for granted! It was also convenient being able to get Internet access at the attached cafe without even having to step outside.And while the hotel isn't on a particularly charming block, it is just around the corner from Dottie's True Blue Cafe, a first rate breakfast place on Jones St. In summary the Adante is a good choice if 1) you're on a budget, and 2) you get a good price.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-02-13"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "This hotel deserves the 5 diamond award!", "text": "We stayed here last July, I live in Las Vegas and have stayed/worked in many of the top resorts, NONE compared to the Amalfi! This is truly a top notch hotel! The front desk is very inviting with a comfortable one on one sit down, the ammenities offered are second to none! Featuring a stocked pay as you go mini refrigerator, Voss water on the end tables, (for a charge) refreshed daily as needed, (we needed them), and double headed Speakman 2000 showerheads the showers were amazing! Cleanliness was first class. Among the top ammenities offered the top 2 was the Continental breakfast served on EVERY FLOOR, not in some dingy breakfast nook downstairs, every floor features a set up next to the elevators every morning! The second top ammenitie was the Coctail hour featured each night! I believe it was 2 hours, free Coctails and hors d'oeuvres! Were not talkin Jim beam and Budwieser here either! It was Jack Daniels Single Barrel and Peroni! Wines were Ferrari Carrano and Robert Mondavie! Every staff member was more than accomadating and friendly, so much you would almost expect they were brainwashed they were so nice! Staying here definatley makes a person feel like a VIP! I would not ever consider staying anywhere else when visiting Chicago! Can't wait to go back!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-12"}

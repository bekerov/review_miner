{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "cold and smelly", "text": "walked in and there was no heat, the linens had holes in them and my room smelled like toilet cleaner. they couldnt fix the heat because they didnt know how and there was only one person on site to help. this place was worse than a 10 dollar hostel in guatemala, by far. they brought some &quot;blankets&quot; that were stained sheets of foam to help with the very cold night. was originally booked for 7 days but left after one. if you are a backpacking teenager you may be able to tolerate a couple of nights here but for a few dollars more you can prob have a clean warm room nearby.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-22"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Perfect Soho location.", "text": "Perfect location, nice design, excellent breakfast, enjoyable small convenient rooms but smell of cigarette in a no smoking room, well set bathroom, good value for NYC, good restaurant (you have to pay a 20% service charge if you are staying at the hotel and not worth the 20%), bar always closed for private parties, staff at reception almost nice, good concierge, slow elevators because of the keys you need to use it.Definitely the best choice in the area.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-06-09"}

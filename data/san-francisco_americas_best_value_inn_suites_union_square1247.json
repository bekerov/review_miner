{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Avoid staying in this Hotel", "text": "They have some nice photos on their webpage, hence, I thought the hotel is okay (&quot;also for business travelers&quot;). Normally, you get what you pay for and I haven't expected much comfort. However, this hotel was a nightmare. The stairs, elevator and the floors have been extremely dirty and smelly. Many guests were drunk all the time, one guy managed it to vomit on the stairs every night, and the staff didn't wipe it up before midday. The room itself was okay (some quite new furniture and a fridge). Even in San Francisco you should easily find a better hotel for that price.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_suites_union_square", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-27"}

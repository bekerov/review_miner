{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Perfect for our Budget", "text": "This was the cheapest hotel we could find in the city for the weekend. We were a little hesitant because of the prior reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised. We were able to check in very early, and by the time we came back from a long day, we still had a place to park. Maybe we got lucky, but even if it was full, there are places to park within walking distance and the metered parking is free after 10 p.m. There are plenty of places to eat, shop and walk to and feel safe. There is even a Walgreens right down the street. The room had all the amenities we needed, including a refrigerator. The only thing..the shower was a little tricky. We couldn't figure out how to turn it on and had to call the front desk. The front desk crew was very helpful, and we would definitely stay there again.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-21"}

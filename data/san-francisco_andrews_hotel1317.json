{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Small but very comfortable", "text": "Yes, the rooms are tiny, and the bathroom is a marvel of creative design with a very small space. But, what do I care? OK, OK, I'm only 5'2&quot;, and I can see that, a six-footer might feel squeezed But, for me, the Andrews was the perfect, cozy little oasis for my business trip to San Francisco. The room was pleasantly decorated and well-appointed, with a little desk one could actually use, a 15-inch LCD TV and DVD player, and a good Wi-Fi signal (very important to me). Also, the staff were friendly and helpful. And, the price is right. I didn't have a chance to sample the restaurant, Fino, but the free glass of wine in the evening was a spare but excellent pinot grigio. It seemed to sum up the Andrews Hotel experience, and I have made the hotel my new favorite for San Francisco. Sure, I can get more real estate somewhere else, but what would I do with it? Give me a friendly, comfortable haven in the big city. If only there were more hotels like the Andrews.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-11-18"}

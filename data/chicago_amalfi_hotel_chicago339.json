{"city": "chicago", "title": "What a NICE hotel!", "text": "Got a great rate at the Amalfi from Last Minute Travel and were really traveling blind as we did not know the layout of the city that well. Dropped off by the airport shuttle and it was only 10AM, so of course our room was not ready. Desk clerk offered to store our things and suggested that we take an &quot;architectural cruise&quot; of the city (only a short 10 minute walk from the hotel) to while away a few hours and get an overview of the city while our room was being cleaned. Took his advise and loved it. Don't miss this tour! Returned about 2PM and immediately checked in. Rooms are a bit on the small side - we had 2 queen beds for myself, my husband and our 16 year old son - however were lacking for nothing. Amazingly comfortable beds, top quality bedding and towels, a nice desk and chair with FREE internet connection and big plasma TV. Every morning there is free Starbucks coffee and scrumptious pastries, fruit, juice, yogurt and bagels on EACH floor. Just pad on out in your pj's and bring it back to your room. Every evening between 5:30-7 there is a cocktail hours with yummy Italian appetizers and an open bar - all top shelf liquor and the best bartenders in Chicago. You have to try their signature drink - the Amalfitini - mmmm.Navy Pier, the Mag Mile, the Riverwalk and Millenium Park all within easy walking distance. Super friendly staff, super clean rooms, BIG bathrooms, nightly turndown service with Ghiardelli chocolates - what's not to love?", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-30"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Better that you'd expect and the best value the area", "text": "This hotel is way nicer that you would expect given the price and the area. Ok, so the neighborhood is kinda borderline, technically in the Tenderloin, but only a block east of Van Ness which is where Cathedral Hill starts. It's about a 10-15 min walk to Union Square, but I would recommend walking up Larkin and then heading east down Geary or Post rather than Ellis which becomes quite scary about 2-3 blocks east of the hotel. It's amazing what a difference a block makes in this area. The rooms open up onto the parking lot, which is also where the ice and vending machines are. There are no interior corridors. The rooms themselves are very nice, looking recently refurbished, including a wall mounted LCD TV with built in DVD player and input to plug in your own equipment such as a video camera should you desire. There is also free wifi and continental breakfast in the lobby. The bathroom is large with some rooms featuring a big jacuzzi tub/shower combo complete with multiple shower heads that spray in different directions. You can have a great time splashing around like a seal in this thing if you don't mind turning into a prune. The bed is average, about like you'd expect at a Comfort Inn. This is also one of the few hotels in downtown SF with free parking, but it is rather limited, so don't count on a space being available if you arrive late in the evening. All said, this place is an excellent deal, just keep in mind that's essentially a really nice motel in a slightly iffy area.", "hotel": "alexis_park_san_francisco", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-06"}

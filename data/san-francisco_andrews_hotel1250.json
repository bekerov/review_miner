{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great value and location of this Downtown Boutique hotel.", "text": "This hotel is located within 3 blocks of Union Square. The front desk staff was very helpful. The rooms were clean. The continenial breakfast just outside the room was very convienent. Some of the rooms have a very small bathroom (ours did) but we didn't find this to be a problem. Loved the quaint antique elevator. The evening complinentary glass of wine was also very nice and helped to interact with other guests in the hotel. Really enjoyed our stay.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-17"}

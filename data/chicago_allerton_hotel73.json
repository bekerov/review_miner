{"city": "chicago", "title": "NIce Hotel but Don't Drive There!", "text": "The entrance is very cool, smells like lemons so that was nice. Lobby is on the 2nd fllor which is odd to me, and check in time was nuts. Kind of annoying that the wifi isnt free - it is in the lobby but you still need to get a passcode, and if its check in...forget about it. Room was cute (small) but stuffy. But here is the kicker - $51 a night to park, and you pretty much *have* to park in the adjacent ramp because there are no other choices. And you feel obligated to tip everyone everytime. Employees at the hotel were helpful and friendly though.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-02-22"}

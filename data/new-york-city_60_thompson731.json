So we take the smaller room. Next day we're told we can change mid afternoon. Mid afternoon comes and goes. I drop down to find out what's happening. I tell a woman at the desk who tells another woman, who goes 'whatever.' Now, she doesn't know I'm there, but still... An hour later I'm shown to a room that's smaller than the one we've just left, smells damp, has a wet floor and joins to another room. Someone's playng rap next door.I don't even bother to unpack.When my partner returns (she's out and made the booking in her name), she drops down to talk to the desk. She gets a guy, he gets us a new room. Everything is fine, except 'whatever' doesn't even look at us for the rest of the week.The new lobby bar looks good, though. Less of a scene going on...", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-11-10"}

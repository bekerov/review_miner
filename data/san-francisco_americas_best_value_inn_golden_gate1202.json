{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Terrible hotel! Very dirty!", "text": "I have never left a review before but I am doing so on this hotel. The hotel does not have complimentary parking or breakfast as advertised. The parking is first come first serve and the breakfast is a muffin and the most disgusting coffee I have ever tasted. I had to spit it out as soon as I tasted it! The bed linens were old and had not been washed in a very long time. They were full of hair and holes....I itched all night long. The beds were so uncomfortable I could not sleep. Please be aware that this hotel is not worth the discounted price. Pay a little more and be confident you are getting a cleaner room with amenities.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-15"}

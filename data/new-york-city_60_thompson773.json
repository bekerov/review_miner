{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "I Love 60 Thompson", "text": "I can't imagine anyone not liking this hotel. I stayed at 60 Thompson in a deluxe king from Thurs. to Sun. and had the most incredible weekend in New York. The staff is as nice as can be. Whatever I requested throughout the weekend was delivered in moments. THE CONCIERGE AT THOMPSON IS THE BEST! They setup our entire weekend. From dinner on Friday, hair cut Sat., Dinner Sat., and a night out for 18 people at one of the most exclusive lounges in NYC. Everything went off without a hitch. The rooms were beautiful. Walk to great shopping in SoHo. The only bad thing I can say about this hotel is that Thom's is slow as molases. Room service was very fast, though. Eat brunch at the Cupping Room, a block away. There was barely any street noise on the 12th floor and the room was a great size for New York. If you're planning a night out on the town with friends this is the spot. The concierge will get you into any restaurant, club, or lounge that you want. The rooms and bathrooms are beautiful.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-02-01"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "This was our anniversary and sadly...the hotel put a damper on it....", "text": "I am loyal to Kimpton hotels, having had very positive experiences in other cities, so I expected the same when booking this hotel for an overnight stay to celebrate my anniversary. When we arrived at the hotel to check in, no one was there to greet us at the curb. We waited for a bit for someone to come out to take our car and no one came. Eventually we drove around, found a parking lot, parked our car, and walked to the hotel with our bags. When we got to the desk to check in, the first thing we were told was that we were going to have to be moved to another hotel because they had overbooked at this hotel. I was clearly upset at this, and then out of nowhere, we were told that someone just cancelled, and we were handed a key to a room. The room we got was tiny, which would have been fine, except the tv was broken. Given that we had planned this night to celebrate our anniversary, we were looking to at least relax and enjoy our day and night. I can certainly say that the hotel portion of our stay was the opposite of relaxing and enjoyable, and that was due to how the check in process was handled from the moment we walked in to the hotel. In addition, we received little help from doormen, etc. We hailed all of our own cabs, as no one offered to help us, and we witnessed doormen texting and paying little attention to guests.  The experience would not have been so bad if it hadn't started so badly. I think it terribly inappropriate to overbook your hotel and then try to ship people off somewhere else because you made a mistake. That is the opposite of good customer service. It makes the customer feel unwanted. I would not stay there again and I would not recommend the hotel to anyone else.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-10"}

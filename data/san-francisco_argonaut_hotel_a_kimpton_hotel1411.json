{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "The best hotel I have stayed at in a long time.....", "text": "My partner and I stayed at the argonaut at the start of our 3 week trip along the west coast of america. I have to say it was the best hotel we stayed at on the trip, we stayed at some great places over the 3 weeks. The location is fantastic and we walked to most places or got the tram which was literally a 2 minute stroll along the pier. We also walked to the golden gate bridge from the hotel which was amazing.The hotel has a nautical theme, not taccy in the slightest, tastefully done and true to its surroundings. The room we had was a standard one I think, 2 queens sized beds. Very big, great bathroom, facilities etc. funky dressing gowns! A great touch was the complimentry wine tasting, needless to say we forgot about our jet lag that night! We didn't eat at the hotel but there were the facitlites there if you needed to. Plenty of other restaurants to visit. You must try the restaurant at the top of macy's looking out on to the square for lunch, amazing and so resonable! Booked our Alcatraz tickets with the concierge without a problem, in general vey helpful. All in all a wonderful 3 night stay and was everything we thought it was going to be and more.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-14"}

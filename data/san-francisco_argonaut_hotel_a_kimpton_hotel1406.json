{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Wonderful location for a first time visit.", "text": "This was our first visit to SF and the location of the Argonaut is excellent. The staff were very friendly and the rooms were spotless and clean. I would suggest a city tour to learn some interesting facts then get out and about on foot &amp; cable car. Opposite the hotel is a Maritime museum which is really nice to stroll around. A visit to Alcatrez is a must, not what I expected at all. Would definitely stay again just on the edge of all the hustle and bustle.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-25"}

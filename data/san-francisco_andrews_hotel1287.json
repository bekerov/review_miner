{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Hotel", "text": "We stayed here for 4 nights in June 2008. Having never been to San Francisco before, we wanted a hotel that was a short walk away from the action.The Andrews Hotel is a perfect hotel for Union Square and all the bars and shopping that come with it. With Union square comes the cable car route that takes you all the way to Fishermans Wharf - the best way to travel.Check in was easy, very polite staff, and we were very pleased with our room on the 7th floor. It wasn't the biggest, but we expected this and was perfectly in character of the hotel.As we were celebrating a belated honeymoon, a bottle of sparkling wine/champagne was waiting for us upon arrival. Very nice! There is only 1 lift, but we never had problems waiting for it, a very nice original feature of the hotel.Breakfasts were nice, left out on each level for guests to go help themselves to tea, coffee, orange juice, fresh fruit and breads.By staying at the Andrews, every night, each guest is entitled to a free glass of wine at the Italian restuarant called Fino that shares the ground floor. This was a nice touch, and we ate there on our first night. The food and service were both very very good. The only problem we encountered was trying to get an international line so we could phone home. We were not successful, despite the help from reception staff, but when the attempts appeared on our final invoice, they were more than happy to wipe it off. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay here, and would definately recommend it to other travellers.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-12"}

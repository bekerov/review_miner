{"city": "chicago", "title": "Amazing value great quality fabulous location", "text": "We did not know what to expect for the reasonable price we paid. Would it be a dump? As it turns out, the rooms were impeccably decorated - though quite small. The location could not be beat. Right in the heart of the Magnificent Mile - walking distance to many attractions. The breakfast at the hotel was quite expensive, but there is a lovely irish pub called The Elephant and Castle right on the corner which has a plentiful and reasonably-priced breakfast.. We traveled with our 5 children, and had a lovely stay. Would definitely return there.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-09"}

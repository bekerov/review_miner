{"city": "chicago", "title": "You Get what you pay for!", "text": "I based our reservations on the positive reviews on this site. The location is really terrific. Close to everything. (Nordstroms Off the Rack is only a few blocks away!)The hotel lobby was filthy. Actually, it was the chairs in the lobby that were very badly stained/soiled. I wouldn't sit down during check in, it was too gross. While we were there they mentioned that they were currently renovating the upper floors of the hotel...hopefully the lobby would be next.The staff were very helpful and service oriented.We had a great room. We had no external noise disturbing us BUT the heating system (which we could not turn off) had stuff pinging in the machinery so it felt like we were sleeping under an airplane hanger. They had great &quot;products&quot; Aveda.The breakfast was a nice touch...but the quality of the baked goods was very poor. We couldn't eat it. So, the fruit, coffee and juice were it for us.The high rating for others surprises me. Its moderately priced hotel because it's a very average hotel.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-01-16"}

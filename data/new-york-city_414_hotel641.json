{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Absolutely wonderful", "text": "This hotel was such a joy to find in the big city. The bed had a down comforter. The staff was extremely helpful. The hotel offered coffee &amp; tea in the kitchen at all times and bountiful breakfast choices for free (bagels, muffins, juice, etc.). The hotel is located on Restaurant Row, with reasonably affordable restaurants with food from almost every country imaginable within a two-mile radius. The street was actually quiet for New York, especially considering that Times Square and many Broadway theaters were just a short walk away. My room overlooked a courtyard, not the street, which was a definite plus. Though it was too cold to sit out there (Thanksgiving), I imagine that it would be a charming place to rewind in warmer months. The room was not large, but it was bigger than several others I've stayed at in Manhattan. Overall, a great bargain. I'm looking forward to staying here again one day.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-01-21"}

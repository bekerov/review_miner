The location is great, the staff is excellent, the rooms are very clean and spacious. I am a little bias to Kimpton Hotels and this place is one to beat in the city. If you want to stay near the Empire State, Grand Central, Times Square, and Central Park, this is your place.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-13"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Excellent hotel - great stay!", "text": "We have just stayed at 70 park avenue and found the hotel to be in a fantastic location with lovely staff and lots of nice little touches. This was our first time in the US and this hotel certainly made us feel very welcome. The wine reception each evening was lovely and greatly appreciated after a day out and about in the busy city. The location is great for sightseeing with bus routes and subway stations just a few minutes walk away - we hardly used them though as the weather was nice so we walked almost everywhere. This is a great place to stay and we would visit again.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-22"}

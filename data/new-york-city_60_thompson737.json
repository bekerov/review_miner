{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great but not fantastic!", "text": "Just returned from a three night stay in a King Suite at 60 Thompson (booked on Quikbook). We were at first slightly surprised to be checking in at the front desk which seemed to be in the middle of the bar area and very loud. But we had a room on 6th floor which was quiet (relative to NY) despite being across from the elevator and facing the street. King Suite was not much of a suite as it only accommodated a small sitting area just adequate for a sofa and table in addition to the bedroom. However we loved the balcony which was the length of the living room and bedroom, we never used the A/C as we could open balcony door in both rooms. Bathroom was very disappointing for a hotel of this standard (no storage place, music or TV in the bathroom). Very little storage place in the room for clothes. Overall the room was finished to a low standard with IKEA quality furniture. The hotel personnel was very friendly at all times and the concierge was helpful at printing from the web once he was not familiar with the location himself. We visited the rooftop lounge twice, which had a nice view but terrible service. Location is fantastic! I would not mind staying at 60 Thompson again, however given the shortcomings listed above and that this is not the only boutique hotel in NY I will try to stay at a different hotel next time.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-08-25"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "The worst hotel I have ever stayed at in the world", "text": "I do not recommend this hotel at all!!! I stayed at the Abigail Hotel (March 10-March 13, 2006). It is the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at. I have posted some photos from my visit. I booked this hotel since it had OK reviews on other websites. I booked two non-smoking rooms and was told that they could not guarantee that the guests had not been smoking there. They even have a no smoking sign on the 6th floor, but I guess it doesn't matter... One of the rooms on the 6th floor was OK (not smelling like a bar), but the other one had both an ash tray in it as well as it was stinking of smoke. I went to the reception and he offered me another room, also smoky, then another room on the 5th floor which was even worse. The corridor had not been cleaned in weeks, with dirt and things lying around on the floor, so I went to the reception once again and I was offered another room on the 6th floor. They did not have an extra key for that one, so someone from the reception would have to accompany me and my husband to open the door every time we needed to enter. Well, I said that was unacceptable, so finally the receptionist found another room on the 6th floor that did not smell. By then I was so tired that I accepted the room.On of the old windows in the entry was broken and has been taped together and it looks unfinished. The owners/employees are not too friendly and hardly says hello when you pass them. The famous Millennium Vegetarian Restaurant has moved to another location, contrary to what it says on other websites.", "hotel": "abigail_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-06-08"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Wonderful Little Place in the heart of New York City", "text": "What a wonderful place to stay in New York City. It is out of the way of all the hustle and bustle but yet close enough to all the excitement. The room was a little on the small side but quite accurate for an enjoyable overnight stay. The bathroom was on the large side and easy to move around in. There was a little INTERNET area just inside the lobby, and they had a great Continental breakfast the next morning. The staff was very informative and a great help. I would definitely stay again at this great little out of the way hotel.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-01-08"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Good Price but some drawbacks", "text": "I stayed at the Amalfi for three nights while attending a conference in Chicago. It was recommended to me by a colleague, so I thought I would give it a try. The staff are all quite pleasant, and room was very clean. The room was quite small, though. I was in a corner room, and it didn't seem to be well though-out when designed. There is a very long hallway, with the bathroom attached, and then the room. The design of the room makes it very tight for walking around the furniture. The bathroom, although poorly lit, was wonderful though. The shower has a dual head and was like heaven. But, the bed could have been more comfortable.The hotel boasts free breakfast and daily happy hour. In truth, the breakfast is just baked goods and coffee. There was a small bowl of fruit, but that's all. And the happy hour was not in a &quot;lounge&quot; but rather a small, dark room, and the bartenders were not very friendly. I took my drink back to my room. The one thing that realoly bothered me was the air in the room. It NEVER shuts off. If you turn the thermostat down, it gets too cold, and if you turn it up, it gets to stuffy. So, I finally just flipped the switch to turn it completely off. It got a little chilly at night, but it was worth it. The staff was accomodating, though. I needed to check out a day early, and they were OK with that - no penalty, which was surprising. The hotel is conveniently located, but there is major construction going on all around it, so it can be a bit noisy. All in all, it wasn't a bad stay - but I'm not sure it was nice enough for me to go back.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-11-02"}

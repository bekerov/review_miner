{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Funky Chic Soho", "text": "I stayed at 60 Thompson for one night this Jan. Overall the hotel has the &quot;w&quot; hotel feel but much more upscale and personal. The inviting second floor lobby is decarated well with huge windowns and funky furniture. The check-in process was quick and all of my requests fullfilled.The room itself is a pretty standard NYC size room.. We checked in put were called in our room right away due to a mix up with someone else already checking into that specific room. We were upgraded to a suite that included a HUGE living room, seperate bedroom, 2 seperate bathrooms, each with walk in tiled showers and seperate tub. The suite was really something else. If you can afford it, it has to be one of the best in the city. Even though we were in the suite, I did see the previous &quot;standard&quot; room and it was like stated before: typically sized for NYC and decarated very funky/chic. The beds were very comfortable and showers fantastic.  I would and will definatly be back", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-14"}

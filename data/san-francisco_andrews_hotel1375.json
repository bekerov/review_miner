It's a pleasant little hotel. The location is close to everything. The staff is nice. The morning buffet was very good and on each floor. The rooms are small but are comfortable.I prefer to be out and about in SF, so the room was fine.The other guests seem to like the place too.The price is a great deal for what you get.It's not a Holiday Inn, so if you have kids and need a pool for them, this is not your hotel.If you're a couple of grownups it's a hotel for you.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-04-05"}

It has been 2 years since I've stayed at 70 Park, and certainly things change, but from the experience I had, I can tell you that I would definitely consider this hotel again. It's true, the halls are narrow, as is the elevator, and there is some noise outside on Park Avenue (because it's New York...but it didn't bother us at all). The reason I write this, though, is because we were privy the best, most sincere service ever. I actually proposed to my wife in NYC, and 70 Park was the hotel I chose to stay for our trip, unbeknownst to her at the time. After booking a King Premier room, I called to let them know that I was staying with them for my surprise engagement. The staff was downright giddy for me, and when I came back to the hotel with my new fiancee, I was greeted with applause and congratulations, as well as a complimentary bottle of champaign, fresh strawberries, and dessert. We dined at the Silverleaf downstairs that evening, and the food was delicious. From our locale, everything we wanted to see was so close. I thought the room was impeccably decorated, the bathroom tile was cool, and the lighting gave the room the warmest glow. Again, we stayed in a bigger room on a higher floor, so I'm not sure what the experience would have been with smaller quarters. But for those four days in New York, 70 Park Ave was a main contributor to memories that we will never forget.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-03-16"}

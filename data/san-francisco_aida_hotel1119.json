{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "BED BUGS ALERT!", "text": "Upon arrival, we were dismayed to find out that the room didnt come with a bathroom. It was cheap but that was it. We had to go to a shared toilet outside the room. What's worse is that the room had a pretty bad smell - as in, it just didnt feel clean. The bed was awful. When we got up, we had bed bug bites all over us. The hotel is close to a nearby disco/pub and the loud music kept us turning and tossing all night. Travellers beware: The price of the room DOES NOT INCLUDE parking for your car. The guy wanted to charge us USD 25 just for leaving our car in his garage. AND get this: the parking garage is TWO blocks away. Imagine this - you are tired and zoned out from driving LV to SF and then lugging your heavy suitcases two blocks to your room. The environment is especially bad. There were unsavoury characters hanging around the entrance of the Aida Hotel. Especially the ATM. Be careful.I wouldnt go back EVEN if the hotel pays me to.", "hotel": "aida_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-18"}

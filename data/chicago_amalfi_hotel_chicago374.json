{"city": "chicago", "title": "Fine but could be better for the money", "text": "I travel frequently on business (both domestically and internationally) and was looking forward to our five-night stay here. Good points: The hotel is in a prime location, just two blocks from the Mag Mile. You're in walking distance (within 2-3 blocks) of several excellent restaurants. The rooms are very clean. And the continental breakfast on each floor is nice (not elaborate--just sweet rolls, some fruit, coffee and juice) and certainly convenient.Mediocre points: For the price and all the glowing reviews I read, I fear it's not quite up to snuff. The service wasn't exactly what I'd call &quot;European&quot; or &quot;upscale&quot; as some other travelers have noted. It's more like a very nice Holiday Inn. The staff is friendly (except for the doorman, who was always excellent), but they don't really go out of their way to make you feel welcome or particularly pampered. All in all, it's &quot;fine&quot; but not $400-per-night worth of fine. Bad points: We had room 311, which backed up to an alley filled with dumpsters. OK, you're not looking out there, but you will hear the garbage trucks emptying every one of the 35 dumpsters at 2am. Not exactly restful. On the first night, we thought, &quot;well, what bad luck but now that's over.&quot; The garbage trucks returned the next night for another two-hour crash BANG BOOM fest. We asked to be moved the next day, which the hotel did. We also asked for an adjustment to the bill (they took off $20 for each of two nights), which they did less readily. If you want a great location, this is it. If you're looking for the European ambiance they tout or 4-star accommodations worthy of the 4-star price tag, look elsewhere. There are plenty of other hotels in Chi-town.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-14"}

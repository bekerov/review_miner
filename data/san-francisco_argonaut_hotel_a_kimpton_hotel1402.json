{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Free wine was the icing on the cake", "text": "We stayed at this hotel in August 2009. It is a relatively small hotel on the sea front at Fisherman's Wharf. We dropped our car off at the valet parking outside the hotel and were immediatley made very welcome. The rooms are spacious, very clean and comfortable. The hotel reception staff were very helpful. Between 5pm and 6pm each eveing there is a wine tasting in the lounge. In reality this is the opportunity to have a few glasses of very nice wine on the house and chat to other residents if you wish.We also received complimentary breakfasts each monring which was a bonus. The hotel is very well positioned for Fisherman's Wharf and very close to the Tram terminus.Overall my wife and I together with our two teenage children enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-29"}

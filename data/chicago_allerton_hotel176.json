{"city": "chicago", "title": "What an ordeal", "text": "We arrived at 5:25 pm on a Friday night (check-in starts at 3:00). We were informed our room (2 beds non-smoking) was not ready yet, but they offered us either a smoking room with 2 beds or a non-smoking room with a king sized bed. We asked how long it would take until it was ready and they called housekeeping. 30 minutes later we still didn't have an answer. An hour went by and the room was still not ready. We offered to go up and either check the room ourselves to see if it was done or clean it ourselves. Long story short: we got in our room 2 hours after we arrived (4.5 hours after check-in begins). We were not charged the upgrade fee for having 2 beds, and they gave us a certificate for 2 free breakfasts. Then we get to the room and it's tiny...I guess we should've taken the room with the king-sized bed, but who knew.Overall, the location is great and the hotel is beautiful, but the room we got was tiny and there seems to be a bit of a communication break-down between the front desk and housekeeping.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-06-18"}

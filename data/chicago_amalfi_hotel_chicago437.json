{"city": "chicago", "title": "Amalfi is the Only place I stay in Chicago", "text": "Have stayed many times at his hotel and it continues to excel in every way including customer service which is my big thing. The lobby is small but the rooms spacious and the decor to my tastes. Very comfortable and the staff is always eager to help with any reservations or recommendations. Valet guys are great but if leaving for dinner make sure to call for your car ahead of time. They do get busy. The Amalfatinis at the free cocktail reception each night are excellent and the breakfast served each morning always a treat. Location is pretty central to everything and around the corner from House of Blues for any shows that may be in town. Often dine across the street at Harry Carry's which is always great. Couldn't ask for more. Will continue to stay here every time I am in town (which is quite often).", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-04-21"}

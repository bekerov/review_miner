{"city": "chicago", "title": "Beware: WORST Service on the Planet!!", "text": "My rating of 1 is extremely generous for the level of service provided to me at the Allerton! If I could render a 0 or a negative rating, I most definitely would. After booking on Hotwire, I called directly to the hotel three times to ensure we had double beds in our rooms, which was confirmed by Allerton staff. When we arrived, the front desk clerk informed us they had booked us for a single room and no more double rooms were available. After expressing our discontent with the manager, he attempted to pacify us with a free breakfast.We had an even more intense and dissatisfying experience with so-called &quot;management&quot; at checkout. In addition, we were charged the $36 fee for valet parking for a night on which our car was supposed to be valeted. However, to our dismay, the car was sitting in front of the hotel (where it was left) in the morning, never having been parked!If you are looking for a nice hotel with great service, the Allerton is definitely NOT the place for you! If you want to waste your money on small rooms, terrible service, rude and extremely incompetent management, and risking the safety of your car, kudos to you...you have come to the right place! Enjoy your disastrous experience!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-07"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Good place to stay in New York", "text": "The 60 Thompson enjoys a good location, which is relatively quick to reach by taxi from JFK (as compared to Midtown hotels for example). It is not in the middle of SoHo action, which makes it a relatively quiet place. Yet, all the hot shopping / dining / drinking spots of SoHo are within walking distance, as is a subway station.Rooms are rather on the small side (but this is New York, after all), and the views are far from great (especially if you don't have a room facing Thompson Street). There is free wi-fi internet access, which is very convenient. The design of the bathrooms is great, and the bath amenities are good.Service is okay, as is dining. The bar is pleasant.Overall a nice place to stay, with a rather residential feel. I tend to think that prices are a little bit high for the product, but again ... this is New York, so that I would consider that the value for money is okay.Although maybe not my first choice in New York, I would probably stay there again.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-06"}

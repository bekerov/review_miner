{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "A Little Gem In New York", "text": "This hotel was fantastic! Having searched the internet for ages trying to find a reasonably priced hotel in the centre of New York, Trip Advisor reviews led us to this hotel. We were certainly not disappointed! The hotel was within easy location of all the main sites that we wanted to see, and was in a quiet residential area just off restaurant row. The room was spacious and clean and we had a lovely view over the pretty courtyard which was a bonus. It was so quiet, you would never know that you were in the centre of New York. An excellent continental breakfast was supplied each day which was fantastic, and there was always plenty on offer. It also gave you a great opportunity to meet other guests which we found rea lly interesting. I had read a lot about Mike from other reviews, and was delighted to meet him on our first night in the 414. He was a genuinely lovely guy, and took time to guide us through the map of New York to help us get to where we wanted to go to each day. He also gave us fantastic recommendations for restaurants in the local area, and he was always spot on!! What an asset to this hotel, I don't think the place would be the same without him.Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the 414 and would definately stay there again. We were lucky to find such a gem in such a big city.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-05-02"}

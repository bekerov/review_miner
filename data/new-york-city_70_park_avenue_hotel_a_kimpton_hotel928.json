{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Very disappointing!", "text": "My husband &amp; I have stayed at Kimpton hotels in Washington DC, and loved them! That's why we decided to try this hotel for a spontaneous trip into NYC for a few days. The room was very old, very small and very dingy. The bathroom was so tiny that no human being could sit on the toilet in the conventional way. And we were shocked that we did not have the YES cable channel. We couldn't watch the end of the Yankee game when we returned to our room after dinner.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-18"}

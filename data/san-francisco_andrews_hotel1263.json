{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Location and friendly staff", "text": "This hotel has a European feel to it. It's 2 blocks from Union Square, nice room, friendly staff, super location. Staff was helpful in giving us directions and ideas of what to do in SF. We were in town for a show and the Andrews Hotel is within walking distance of the theater. We especially liked the breakfast served on each floor and the complimentry glass of wine in the evening was a nice bonus. The restaurant looked inviting. Next time we come back we will definately try the Finos Restuarant.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-13"}

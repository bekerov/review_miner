{"city": "chicago", "title": "Lovely Hotel!!!", "text": "Absolutely perfect hotel stay. We drove in from Detroit, and were met by a nice front desk staff. The concierge was absolutely fantastic...they gave us excellent recommendations for restaurants. The nightly happy hour and daily breakfast buffet was just what we wanted for our weekend in Chicago. Very hip and stylish hotel too! Only complaint would be the internet connection. Was not fast at all and kept cutting out. Keep this in mind if you're a business traveler staying here.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-24"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Its OK just don't overpay", "text": "Allerton is an older hotel with a great location in Chicago. It was refurbished but the rooms are small. Amenities are few - showercaps not provided. Staff is not that helpful - arrived with 4 bags in a taxi and the bellman told us where to go but did not even offer to take the bags. Lost my reservation but I got a room anyway. Lobby is on third floor, entrance on first, have to take an elevator to get in or out. Room is clean, bathroom is fine, bed is a little small. No minibar or safe in room.Basically, if you are not paying too much, its an OK hotel. I would not spend more than $150 a night for this hotel.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-12"}

Room 607 was comfortable &amp; quiet enough. Perhaps most importantly, absolutely everything was CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN. About 3 short blocks away from cheap public bus that goes all over town to most of the sights &amp; neighborhoods u definitely want to see. Will stay here on every future visit to SF.

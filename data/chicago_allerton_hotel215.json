{"city": "chicago", "title": "Good Value", "text": "I stayed one night at this hotel. Excellent location right in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. Attractive public spaces. The elevators were very small but efficient. I got a great pre-paid internet rate of $89.00 which was about 75% off of the official rate. My room was small but comfortable. Since the hotel is old, it had some character which I liked a lot. The bed was clean, but not as comfortable and nice as the great beds many hotels have today. The shade was old and would not raise in one window, and there was no shade in the other window. No problems with noise. Good airconditioning. Bathroom was small but clean. There were a few nicks and worn spots here and there, but nothing that was unacceptable. Overall, for the price, this was a great deal. I would stay here only with a pre-paid internet discounted rate. I would not pay the public rates.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-05-18"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Not Quite There", "text": "Usually stay at the Soho Grand around the corner, but tried this place because of the location and web site, that promised similar lodgings.Good points: - free broadband internet - all-marble bath with nice marble shower stall - nice room layout, even in smallest room, with sofa - 24 hour room service - DVD player Bad points: - DVD player did not work - called housekeeping at 10:45am to clean room, showed at 1:30pm - no rental movies on TV, hotel DVD's rent for $10/day - elevator requires room key for access - room A/C did not work (but the windows open...) You can get the &quot;60 Thompson&quot; experience by sitting in the radiant heated bar outside - that is when it's open. Still, 60 Thompson is better than most Midtown hotels, if only for the location.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-02-21"}

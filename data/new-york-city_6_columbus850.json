{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Dark interier over rated hotel", "text": "A boutique hotel that tries way to hard. Dark over all feel. Cow skin panels in elevators and downstairs. Room 86 was $150. more then room 26, exactly the same size. Both have a view of the alley! If it had a park view maybe, but for the money it was riducuously overpriced. The elevator and our bathroom were sprayed many times with some sort of bug spray. It was disgusting! Truly wished we had stayed somewhere else.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-08"}

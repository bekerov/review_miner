{"city": "chicago", "title": "amalfi hotel review", "text": "We stayed here in the summer of 06 as we had read great reviews and got a great price on orbitz. The hotel is centrally located and its staff were very pleasant. Our room looked out over the street, we were right across from the harey carey restaurant. The room was HUGE, very clean, big bed, free wireless. The bathroom was also really big and had two shower heads, very very handy. Included in the price was a continental breakfast, which we could collect in the area right by the elevators. Most of the guests were still in their bathrobes when they collected it! choice consisted of muffins, pastries, fruit etc, nice nice choice. Will definitely be staying here again.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-13"}

Our room had a very funky smell and just needed general updating. We had a problem where we were leaving for the evening and our door wouldn't lock, it took an hour to get it fixed which of course messed up our evening plans. The breakfast buffett was good! It wasn't a horrible experience but there are better places to stay for the money.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-19"}

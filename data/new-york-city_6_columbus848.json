{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great location otherwise disappointing", "text": "We have just returned from 3 nights booked directly via hotel website which states Roof Top terrace, unfortunately, the terrace is closed until next year and consequently we found it difficult to find a seat at the already small bar area.The reception staff, housekeeping and door staff were friendly and helpful, although one couldn't help feeling they were looking for a tip.The price of $480 for a double room became $540 after 4 different taxes, despite luxurious decor, the view from the window of the building shaft led us to conclude this was an extortionate price and did not represent value for money.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-16"}

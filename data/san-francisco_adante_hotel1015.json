{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Decent place with affordable prices", "text": "I not going to add to much in the previous reviews.This hotel is well located, the rooms are little bit smal, but well, and they offer free &quot;breakfast&quot; (in fact bread, coffe and juice).Staff is also nice, but not outstanding.The price is OK and if want to visit San Francisco without spending a lot of money, staying in a simple and honest hotel this is a great deal.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-12-14"}

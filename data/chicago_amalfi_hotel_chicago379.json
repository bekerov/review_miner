{"city": "chicago", "title": "Exceeded Expectations", "text": "This hotel was very nice indeed for my first stay in Chicago, it exceeded my expectations and was a brilliant price. I had no complaints, the room was well maintained ie fresh towels and bed linen daily, and the breakfast was good to get you started for the day, the front desk and doormen were good for advice, the complimentary drinks were a nice extra. Over all a lovely stay in a centrally located location.Good nearby restaurants included Harry Carrys (accross the road) for a beer and bar chips, (bit pricey for food but the Bruschetta was amazing), Rockit bar and grill (located behind the hotel) best burgers and cheap, and Quartino's ristorante and pizzeria (626 North State Street) great for small plate dining.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-03-25"}

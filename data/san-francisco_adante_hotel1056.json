{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Adante will see our family again", "text": "The Adante suited our 6 night stay including a 14 month old. The front desk clerk upgraded our room to a suite for $10 per night, this was very affordable due to original nightly rate being $60 odd dollars. I appreciated that the clerk recognised we needed a little more room with tour toddler. I can recommend the Adante without a problem for families who wish to spend money on other things such as sight seeing etc. The room was newly renovated with big screen TV's in both king size bedroom and lounge that also converted into a fold out bed. The bathroom very clean and modern, in fact we were very satisfied with all the room features. Fresh coffee to brew when your room was made up every day, we had a back room which was very quite though I don't mind the noise in any case (sirens etc). The locality was great with Union Square and transport close, a Walgreens is a 2 minute walk on Geary Street so when any snacks or drinks required they could be collected close by. The staff were friendly and one afternoon is was too wet to venture out so we sat in the attached cafe with a delicious coffee (they serve beer too) and watched the world go by out on Geary street. Family friendly restaurants are within 2 minutes walks from the hotel (Diners or similar) so after dark you don't have to stroll to far in this is an issue. We'll give the Adante 10/10 for great value for money.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-02-10"}

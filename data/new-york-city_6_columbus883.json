{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Uncomfortably small", "text": "I booked this hotel for two nights, but left shortly after arriving. The &quot;King Superior&quot; room is the tiniest NY hotel room I have ever (almost) stayed in. It is uncomfortably small, to the point of claustrophobia.There is a floating desk against one wall, but no chair to sit in - nor even would one fit between the desk and foot of the bed. The bathroom is basic and, although renovated, is crowded and equally uncomfortable.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-30"}

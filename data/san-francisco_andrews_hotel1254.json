{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Service Good Value", "text": "We found that most San Francisco hotels were extremely over priced (compared to other destinations traveled). The Warf area started at about $260-$300 per night, and the accommodations were OKAY but not worth the price (to us).Andrews Hotel was near Union Square, a short (street car) ride away from the touristy areas. The Hotel is an old building (Historic) with small but comfortable rooms. It is a little noisy but the city sounds are part of the experience. ~ just be aware of it.Complimentary wine in the afternoon was unexpected, and continental breakfast outside our room made waking up (early) a pleasure.The front desk was helpful and always had a solution for us. They assisted printing our boarding passes, recommended transportation, helped with restaurants, directions etc. Our room was cleaned promptly every morning as we left to explore the city. Fresh towels, new toiletries were never an issue.The hotel carpeting and decor is a little dated and should be replaced, and (as with most buildings built in the early 1900's) there is no A/C. You wont need the A/C so don't worry. ~It's always chilly in the summer, but it does add a little noise with the windows open.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-21"}

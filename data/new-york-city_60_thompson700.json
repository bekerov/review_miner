{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Terrible", "text": "I was looking forward to staying at 60 Thompson because of the great location, but certainly would not repeat that mistake again. The tiny, somewhat outdated room was like sleeping in an oven - 90 degrees with no way to adjust the temperature except opening the window and thereby introducing the scream of police cars, etc. off 6th Ave. Staff was useless. Easily one of the worst nights I have spent in a hotel anywhere in the world. I left as soon as possible. You would be a fool to choose this hotel. You'd be better off gettting a bench in the park.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-01-01"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Fantastic Hotel!!!!", "text": "This hotel was brilliant. On arrival, the doormen asked for our names as we were a party of 6, and took our bags inside. When we were checking in, the manageress came out and asked was it OK that she had upgraded all of our rooms as she had seen it was a girls holiday!! Of course we said yes!!The rooms were spotless and the beds and pillows were the most comfy i can ever remember in any hotel I've stayed in!Each night the room was turned down and towels, toiletries and water was replaced.It was so close to Central Park, and the Time Warner building across the road has some nice shops and i would definitely recommend the Porter House restaurant in there too!We got great rates for this hotel on Quikbook.com and if i am lucky enough to get back to NYC, i'd definitely stay there again!! Well worth a visit!", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-04"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Amazing value", "text": "I stayed at the Andrews in July 2004. I was really impressed by the personal style, the location and the breakfast. I had read that you needed to be quick with the breakfast but that was not our experience. There was a wide variety and more than enough available.The rooms were a little small for 2 people however, for the price and location, you could really not ask for more. Only minor suggestion - bedside tables. The hotel staff were really friendly and made you feel like they were welcoming back an old friend. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone and will certainly be back.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-10-13"}

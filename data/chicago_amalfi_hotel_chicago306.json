{"city": "chicago", "title": "love this hotel - beautiful outstanding staff and near everything to see in Chicago!", "text": "My husband and I went to Chicago this past weekend for our anniversary. Honestly the Almafi Hotel dropped into our laps, as we didn't have a clue where to stay. But upon looking at other great reviews and for the price, we went for it. And it was wonderful - we had a corner, king size suite. We were blown away as soon as we opened the door - fairly large suite with two rooms (sofa and large HD TV in one and fairly large bedroom with king bed, HD TV in the other), with windows in each room that extended all throughout, looking out onto the streets of Chicago. Very fun and trendy, CLEAN, double-headed shower, lots of fun amenities like CD's, books, magazines, and Aveda spa products in the bathroom with vanity mirror and stool. Beautiful and tasty breakfast in the morning on each floor and free drinks at night in the bar that were excellent. And the staff was incredibly friendly (always saying hello with a smile) and very eager to help in any way, from planning events to storing your luggage on check out day if your flight or train doesn't leave until later. The hotel is a 20 minute walk from Union Station or 5 minutes by bus (124). Can't beat this hotel, honestly!!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-10"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Such a cute hotel!", "text": "I stayed in NYC for the dates of 5/11-5/14 on a business trip. I chose the 70 Park Avenue due to its location and decor. Overall I was very pleased, and my impression just got better and better throughout the week. I have broken my review out below into different categories: HOTEL: The lobby is very nicely decorated inside, although I thought the spot between the elevators and the restaurant were very cramped. I was never able to take advantage of the wine and cheese reception because it ended at 6 and the timing was never right. RESTAURANT/BAR: The women who was the supervisor of the morning breakfast was awesome! She was very accomodating and always went out of her way to make sure you had everything you needed. In the bar, the evening bar tender (girl with short brown hair) was GREAT! It was nice talking to her while I dined solo at the bar. BELL STAFF: These guys were amazing! They always opened the door for you and were always there to grab a cab. ROOMS: Very nicely decorated. Small, but that was okay with me as I wastraveling alone. I had no view, which I would've loved to have had. The only major complaint I had about the rooms was that they were very dim. Overall, great stay and I would definently stay again. This hotel is in a great location for business or a relaxing romantic weekend. If you are looking for more of a party atmosphere, I might choose a different neighborhood, as Murray Hill is very quiet at night.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-22"}

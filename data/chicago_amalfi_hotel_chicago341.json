{"city": "chicago", "title": "LOved The Amalfi", "text": "We stayed for just one night ,but the hotel staff was extremely friendly and polite. The rooms were clean and large. The decor had just been redone. The best perks were the complimentary continental breakfast on each floor in the morning and the free cocktail hour with premium drinks and great appetizers at night. We got a great rate and would go back. Great location for walking around.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-19"}

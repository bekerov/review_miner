{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "You know what it's really an ok hotel!", "text": "I stayed at the Adante this past weekend, and although I felt a little uneasy walking into our rooms due to the lack of windows and ridiculous decor, I immediately settled in and was suprisingly comfortable in my surroundings. The rooms were exceptionally clean and comfortable, and the management is very helpful. I checked in at 4am on the day I arrived and they ended up not charging me for that night, they just called it an early check in. There was also a discrepancy with the price quote I was given and that was immediately rectified by the polite and friendly manager without hesitation! In the mornings there is a free continental breakfast in the lobby which consists of OJ, coffee, and bread and a toaster with butter and jams. Off of the lobby there is a small cafe with free internet. If you're looking for the Four Seasons or even the Holiday Inn, this place is not for you. However, if you're looking for a basic room to rest your head and to take a shower in a clean eviornment and then leave to enjoy the city, this place is for you. My only advice is if you valet your car, call way in advance as it takes more than the 10 minutes that they tell you. You can't beat this hotel for its location and price. I would stay here again.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-02-23"}

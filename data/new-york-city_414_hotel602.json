{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Lovely little hotel", "text": "Myself and a friend stayed at the 414 hotel for 5 nights in January and it was lovely! The hotel is very cosy and warm and our twin room was nice and spacious with really comfortable beds. The ensuite bathroom was also large and clean with a large mirror and they changed our towels every day. There was also a large mirror in the room, along with an ironing board, safe, TV etc. We had to ask for a hairdryer but they provided one with no questions asked. The hotel is in a great location, 2 blocks from Time square and just off restaurant row where it was easy to jump in a cab to go up or downtown. The subway at time square is pretty close too! The hotel also provided a nice breakfast of coffee, juice, bagels, croissants etc which was lovely and there were also some great diners to go for breakfast close by as well as some great restaurants. Becco was our favourite. The staff were all really friendly especially the owner and Jessica and made us feel very welcome!We loved New York and would defintely go back to the 414 - its not luxury but its all you need and great if you are on a budget! PS Top of the rock at the rockafeller centre is amazing and in our opinion better views than the empire state building!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-01-27"}

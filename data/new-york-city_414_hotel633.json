{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "What's not to love?", "text": "I stayed here for one week in May 2005. There was nothing about the 414 that didn't please me. The location is great - close to theatres and Restaurant Row. (Walk to the Market Cafe near 9th &amp; 37th - had a TERRIFIC meal there! Although, many talk about surly waitstaff - we had no problems.) The room was clean and stylishly modern overlooking a garden courtyard - situated between two &quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot; buildings. My room was in the &quot;back&quot; building, was quiet and I had no trouble with noise at all - and I am a light sleeper! Each morning there was a very nice breakfast available - cereal, juice, fresh pastries - a great start to the day! The staff were really great and it felt like a home away from home. Mike is REALLY terrific! He was helpful in every respect and gave me some great restaurant recommendations! I have NEVER been happier with accomodations before - I'll certainly be back!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-06-17"}

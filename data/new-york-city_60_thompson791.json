{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Beautiful perfect chic", "text": "I feel fortunate to have been able to find an affordable rate that allowed me to stay one night at this utterly gorgeous hotel ($179 for a large queen room with large bathroom on our corporate travel agency's website instead of $400+).Every single detail in this hotel is lush and beautiful. From the elevators to the rooftop bar, the design is warm minimalist chic.The bathroom goodies - from Fresh - with Frette bathrobes - complement the beautiful dark marbled tile and fabulous power shower.The room comes with large TV (hidden, naturally), DVD player, CD player, and a bunch of fun items for purchase (T-shirts that say &quot;My boyfriend is out of town&quot;).Instead of a bureau, the room comes with a sleek sofa with velvet cushions.I just adore this place.Oh, and the staff are friendly and room service prompt.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-07-01"}

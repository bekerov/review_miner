{"city": "chicago", "title": "Will stay again!", "text": "I had a wonderful stay at the Amalfi while I was in Chicago. It was over the Thanksgiving holiday and the hotel was a treat. The staff was helpful with any questions and booking of reservations that I needed. I even needed to extend my stay a night while there and the front desk made sure I kept my wonderfully low rate!The morning buffet and afternoon drinks were awesome. Considering that they are complimentary, and part of the room price, they were more than expected. (loved the artichoke hearts-yum) Just make sure you wake up early enough to grab the goodies in the morning! The rooms were also quiet, even with me being right by the elevator, and the beds were great. The bathrooms were great too with more than enough room. I even loved the Aveda products (the shower gel was nice and refreshing!)It is a quick walk to anywhere you want to go, or a short cab ride/rail ride. One word of caution, if you are looking for a hotel that is completely full service with a restaurant/bar inside the hotel that is open at all hours, this isn't the hotel for you. But, who really needs that in Chicago?", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-01-12"}

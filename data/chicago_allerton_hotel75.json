{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great value at the Allerton!", "text": "We booked our trip for last Friday/Saturday on hotwire about 2 weeks before the trip. My husband and I were taking a short weekend to Chicago for some good eating and relaxing. We paid 180 with taxes total- 90/night with taxes. I was nervous about all the reviews and complaints on TA but I had no reason to be. To start- the staff was very friendly and accommodating-in fact- I told them that we had met in Chicago years ago and were here for a relaxing romantic getaway and then I asked for a queen size room instead of a double which is standard for hotwire customers at this hotel. We were given our key and went to our room. To our surprise we were given a room on the top floor (24). It was a suite with a living room, a huge bathroom and a king size bed! We were in tears! We also went back downstairs to tip the staff that helped us. The elevators were super quick all weekend and we never had any issues either. I'm sure the rooms that are smaller are well- small...but for the price- even one of the small rooms is a deal at 90 bucks a night including taxes for a wknd. Our only issue with the room was the water pressure- but we were on the top floor so we figured this was why we had low water pressure. We thought the rooms were beautifully decorated too. Would we stay here again? Yes, however I don't think it's worth full price. If you can get a good deal- say under 120 in the winter and under 150 in the summer- I'd book it. The location is TOP notch! We walked to everything!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-30"}

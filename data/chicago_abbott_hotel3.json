{"city": "chicago", "title": "Horrible Experience", "text": "I have stayed in a decent amount of cheap hotels in my lifetime so I can say that I have grown used to the lack of commodities and luxuries that come with more expensive finds. However, for being the most expensive cheap hotel I have ever stayed in, it was by far the least admirable. There were hairs in the sheets, rust in the bathtub, no hot water in the shower, BLOOD on the sheets, and the heat did not work (and anyone in chicago during the fall and winter nights can tell you that heat is a bare necessity!). When we asked for new sheets and more towels we were told that the linen closet was locked and that there was no way to get in without the key. In the morning, at about 12:05 pm, &quot;maintenance&quot; came pounding on our door demanding to us that we had to leave since checkout time was at 12. When we responded by assuring her we would be out in 5 minutes she yelled back at us, &quot;NOW!&quot; On our way out we asked to speak with the manager, and the same lady who claimed to be management told us that the manager was not present at the time....If you are looking for a cheap hotel or motel in the Chicago area try to stay away from the Abbott Hotel, and if you don't mind staying in a less-than-nice neighborhood be sure to check out the Chicago Lodge on W. Foster in 60640. It wasn't bad for $86--certainly seemed like a luxury motel compared to this crap hole.", "hotel": "abbott_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-11-08"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Outsiders guide to Allerton Hotel", "text": "Here are a few points for those who do not know Chicago well.Located in the heart of the magnificent mile, this is a very nice hotel. Clean rooms, all updated. Shower pressure is a bit weak. Staff is very friendly. All surrounding restaurants are mostly upper-scale. This may or may not be for you. If you find a hotel further south towards the Art Institute, you may find less swanky restaurants.(For all 'Priceline' reviewers: you pay next to nothing for a hotel, then have expectations???)There are different level of rooms. Small/non-suite rooms, which have either a full, queen, 2 queens, or 1 king bed. These are also grouped into view of Michigan avenue, no view, near elevator, upper floors, etc. Then there is the junior suite, then the king suite. If you pre-paid for a room, they will try and upsell you to a suite. also note this motel is about 1/2 a mile from the red train, which can connect you to the blue line which goes to OHare Airport. To get to red line, you go up Chicago Rd. You can also take a taxi to get directly on the Blue line.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-03-27"}

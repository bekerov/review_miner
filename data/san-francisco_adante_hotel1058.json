{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great location ", "text": "What a wonderful old hotel in a wonderful location in San Francisco. Just 4 safe blocks from Union Square, near the theatres &amp; lots of shopping. The lobby has a nice fireplace, relaxing chairs &amp; sofas, and a variety of very handsome men who work at the check-in. The hotel attracts a wide variety of visitors - esp. families with children, foreign travelers, and gay &amp; straight singles &amp; couples.I was surprised at the level of service for such a great price. From check-in to check-out, it was very smooth. They have a free baggage room so you can store your bags safely if you arrive early or leave late. The maids are very helpful &amp; the rooms are very clean. There is a free continental breakfast, with an attached bar/grilll if you want more.The only downsides were no view out of the window &amp; a smoke-detector that went off when I took a shower. Luckily there was no fire, because no one showed up when the alarm went off. LOL.I would gladly stay there again (as I did at Thanksgiving), and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great, safe, and welcoming hotel at a nice price.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-12-05"}

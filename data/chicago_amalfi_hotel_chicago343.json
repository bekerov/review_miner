{"city": "chicago", "title": "A good rate made this a great deal", "text": "We needed a one night stop over in in December Chicago on our way to Vegas, and we were initially made aware of the Amalfi from a contributor on the TA forum when we sought some suggestions. At that tie of year bargains were to be had and we settled on a rate of about $180 inc taxes. Considering the location and specification, this sounded like a bargainLocation-wise it is about a 10 minute walk off the Magnificent Mile, and about the same from Clark and Lake station, so it's pretty convenient for the airport transit and the main drag. Boutique pretty much sums this up. Rooms are cosy and classy with quite high specification nik naks and toiletries. Although others have made variable comments about the lobby breakfasts, we thought these were great. You could pick up your tea, coffee, muffins, fruit, yogurt or whatever from just outside your bed room door in your robe, and then retreat back inside and polish it off on your bed while you're watching the morning news. What's wrong with that?Check in and out was easy, although I would say that the check in staff had that &quot;edge&quot; of aloofness that might have ruffled one or two. Warm and welcoming they weren't but rude they were not. And yes, and not all rooms have a view. Overall I'd have to say that on a future trip to Chicago, this is the first place we'd try. You could pick one or two faults with it if you tried, but I reckon you need to be trying", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-11"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Location", "text": "This hotel is definitely a good choice and very reasonably priced for the location - only 2 blocks from Times Square and only a five minute walk from 'Restaurant Row'. The rooms were very spacious and the staff were really friendly also - breakfast was a bonus. My only criticism is that the shower pressure was quite poor for the US but apart from that I would defo book in here again.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-03-15"}

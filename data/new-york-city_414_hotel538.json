{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Very pleased", "text": "We stayed at Hotel 414 6/29 to 7/2, 2007. This lovely boutique hotel is ideally situated for seeing the sights of NYC - just two blocks from Times Square and right on Restaurant Row. The rooms are small and a bit musty smelling but to be expected for NYC and age of the building. Bed was very comfortable and the giant flat screen tv nice after a day of pounding the pavement.Lovely courtyard with pleanty of seating for putting your feet up with a tall cool one between sightseeing and dinner.Only downside - carpet in room was in dire need of cleaning and the radiator in the bathroom was in desperate need of replacement - was rusty and falling apart.The staff were pleasant and helpful. Continental breakfast okay - no complaints. Free internet access in the lobby was a nice touch.Had a very pleasant stay and would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-07-04"}

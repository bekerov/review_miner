{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Unique hotel", "text": "Summer vacation for us. We stayed 4 nights at the Argonaut. The building is a renovated Del Monte canning plant I believe. Nicely decorated in a nautical theme. Everything is neat and clean. Staff mostly attentive but this was a VERY busy time of year it seems. Although the staff tried to be helpful it felt like there were just too many demands being placed on them and some were overlooked. Small things. Location is great, right at Fisherman's wharf, you can see Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz from the hotel. Also the famous Buena Vista is a few steps away for your late night Irish Coffee or breakfast . Despite being so close to all this activity, our room (which faced the street) was remarkably quiet.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-10"}

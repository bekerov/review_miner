{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Location and comfortable accomodations", "text": "My husband and I spent our anniversary in Chicago and stayed at the Amalfi Hotel. We had a FABULOUS experience. We loved the views from our room. It was also nice that they had breakfast on every floor so you didn't have to venture far to get a croissant and juice...we would throw on our robes that were provided in our room and would walk down the hall to grab breakfast. The location of the hotel is great as well. We were within walking distance of the Magnificent Mile and the theater district. Anything further is just a cab ride away, which the hotel would gladly arrange for you if you asked. We will definitely stay here again!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-05"}

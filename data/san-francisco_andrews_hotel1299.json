{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "A San Francisco gem!", "text": "Andrews Hotel was the perfect place to stay in San Francisco - we had heard of friends staying in some really bad areas of the city, so we were nervous about getting the right hotel as we were two girls travelling alone, in our early twenties.The outside of the hotel was small and the decor was dated but our room was clean and comfortable and the breakfast was excellent.The real jewel in the crown of Andrews is Fino's - the stunning Italian Restaurant next door. We enjoyed two fantastic meals there. The staff are also to be commended as they went out there way to make us welcome and helped us to organise trips. We particuarlly recommend the wine tasting trip to Napa Valley. Location was good - 2 minutes from Union Square and tram stops. We felt safe at night and were comfortable walking back from the cinema on Mission St.A great hotel for a good price - location, staff and restaurant can't be faulted.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-22"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Would Definitely Stay Here Again", "text": "My fiance and I stayed here for 2 nights this past week. We both agree that we would stay here again when in Chicago. The rooms are very clean, the bed is comfortable, there is a very cool radio with iPod deck, and the shower heads are really neat (there are dual heads that you can adjust). The one thing that makes it not excellent is that the hotel was a bit weird. It didn't feel like a luxury hotel, it felt like almost like an apartment/office building. Otherwise, it was great. The business center is 24 hours with a free printer and the fitness center was also 24 hours. I didn't make it to the reception but my fiance did and though it was very nice with beverages, cheeses, meats and crackers. The breakfast was so-so (there is a toaster in the 6th floor lounge to toast your bagel) but not bad. It was nice that it was on the floor so you didn't have to go very far. The location can't be beat, it's around everything. We walked to A Mano, which was literally down the block and to the left on N Dearborn and that was a nice, romantic experience. We also got a really good deal on the hotel website for about $153 per night (not including taxes).", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-31"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "60 Thompson is fantastic", "text": "I stayed at 60 Thompson in September 2009. Everything about it was fantastic -- the location, the rooms, the staff, etc. The design of the room is beautiful, and it was a good size, especially for a NYC hotel room. You can't beat the location, since it's in SoHo. You can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, shops, etc. My room overlooked the street, but it wasn't loud at all (at least for me).I'd definitely recommend 60 Thompson!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-01"}

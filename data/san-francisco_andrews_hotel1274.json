{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Enjoyed our stay at the Andrews", "text": "My husband and I stayed 4 nights at the Andrews and would recommend this hotel to any budget minded traveler to San Francisco. We stayed in a corner king room on the second floor. The room was small and the bathroom was also small but the place had a historic charm. I will agree with others who posted comments about the hotel being noisy as in street noise. We always travel with earplugs and we used them this trip. We heard lot of noise from the street and the alley but I expected it being in the city. We enjoyed the continental breakfast in the mornings and the wine in the evening. The front desk staff were helpful and they printed out our airline boarding passes. The location is great and very easy to find many restaurants in easy walking distance. FINO in the hotel is also a great dining option. In searching for a hotel in SF one finds the prices can be extremely expensive. The Andrews was very affordable and I felt I got a great bargain at the Andrews.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-29"}

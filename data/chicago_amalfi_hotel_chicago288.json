{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great stay at reasonable rate", "text": "We had a great stay at the Amalfi, room was very comfortable although they vary in size for the same price. The evening reception was a definite plus, good assortment of appetizers and a choice of top shelf drinks, but the line was long on the weekend nights and not enough space to sit and socialize. The free morning breakfast was conveniently located on each floor. I really liked how this hotel didn't nickel and dime you for extras like many Chicago hotels do. Also I appreciated the hotel giving us a late check out as we weren't leaving until late afternoon. The best part was we booked the room at an excellent special price on the hotel's website.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-08"}

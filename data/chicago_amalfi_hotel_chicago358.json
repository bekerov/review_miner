{"city": "chicago", "title": "I would not stay again", "text": "The best thing about this hotel is the location. After that the place is pretty mediocre at best. The rooms are small. The bathroom is serviceable. There are lots and lots of hotels in this area. I know people seem to rave about this place. Do not believe it, the place is just OK. I think you can do much better for the price in or near this area.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-25"}

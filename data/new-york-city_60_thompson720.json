{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "great location great restaurant mediocre hotel", "text": "60 thompson is a trendy hotel in a superb location and a fantastic restaurant. However, the rooms are extremely small for the prices they charge. Also, they are now in need of renovation as the furniture is old and shabby. The worst part of the hotel is the 3rd floor which is directly above the bar area and the noise can be heard in the room until 2 am. If you must stay at this hotel - avoid the 3rd floor at all costs as you will not get any sleep. Unfortunately, noone warns you of this problem when you book the room but it should be known that the 3rd floor cannot be used as a hotel floor. Great restaurant though and the location in Soho is close to everything.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-03-20"}

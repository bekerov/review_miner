{"city": "chicago", "title": "Comfortable Stay at the Amalfi", "text": "We spent a week at the Amalfi whilst on holiday in Chicago. The room was comfortable, although a little dark! The room housed a big TV (good), DVD/CD (bad quality), Aveda Products (nice touch), and magazines (again, nice touch). The bed was huge and comfy. The breakfast buffet was a big plus if you are on a budget. The drinks reception served quality drinks and antipesto but was a strange experience (small dark room/no windows/lots of people). If you stay at the Amalfi make sure that you get out of the hotel and experience all the great bars that Chicago has to offer - do not just go to the Amalfi drinks reception!! The staff were very efficient and welcoming and we had no compaints with the service offered. If you do stay, make sure that you go for a steak at Harry Carey's opposite the Amalfi and Vong's Thai Kitchen (VTK) behind the Amalfi. Both are great restaurants and worth investigating.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-04-15"}

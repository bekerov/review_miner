{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Room and Good Location", "text": "It didn't start out well when our town car pulled up to the Amalfi. Our driver jumped out to unload our bags, but the doorman just stood at his post as if he didn't see us. Not exactly a four star welcome. We brought our own bags inside (tiny lobby, nice, modern but not somewhere yoou would want to relax after a long trip) The bell boy quickly taged and stored our bags and the front desk staff was nice and helpful. We were early and no rooms were read. No problem I said but please do your best to try to get us a nice one, we'd rather wait than be looking at an air shaft.Got a call during our lunch and we were offered an upgrade to a suite, not 2 beds as we had hoped for, but a suite. It was Beautiful. Curved windows, great space. Thanks!Really a nice comfortable small hotel, great continental breakfast in the morning, clean rooms and perfectly located. Only lacked a heater in the bathroom.I was surprised that no one had mentioned the construction acroos the street when I researched the hotel, but there was no real disturbance from it!The staff was not the most welcoming and friendly I have encountered in Chicago, and I always felt they were lacking adult supervision, but the service was professional.There are lots of choices for nice hotels downtown and I think The Amalfi deserves consideration.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-30"}

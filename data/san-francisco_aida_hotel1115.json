{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Would have preffered Bates Hotel", "text": "Cannot warn you enough about not staying here. It is terrible. Area is extremely rundown and full of hoods. A sign inside the office window about $20 per person for a police call-out fee explains alot! They had completely wrong information about our reservation. We ended up in haggle session over a twin hotel room, as they had firstly told us there were none available for the rate we had been given in our reservation, only after threating to stay only 1 night, there was suddenly a room available for the 3 nights that we wanted. This happend to two couples behind us also, i know this, because, as we were waiting inside the elevator in the lobby to take us up to the 3rd floor, the door suddenly started opening and closing, taking us nowhere. Apparently it hadnt been going for a while. I pity those who had to drag their luggage up to the 6th floor. We were also told there was only one room key, so to give it back whenever we went out, we didnt. Although somehow they still managed to get in to change the towels. The room was decent, but not to scratch for what we paid. Towels had yellow stains on them. The area is VERY seedy. Definately the wrong end of town.", "hotel": "aida_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-31"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great location. Excellent suite! Very good choice for downtown Chicago.", "text": "I stayed at the Allerton for a work conference and overall we all had a very good experience. Because I was one of the conference coordinator I had a suite. It was one of the nicer suites I've stayed in. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The room had two flat screen tvs and a Ipod docking station. The bathroom was good, with a nice shower and good water pressure. The only issue I had with my room was 1. there was no refrigerator to put odds and ends in and 2. though there was a sink there were very few glasses and no plates or silverwear. The suite was quiet and I could not hear what was going on in the hallway of the hotel, but I could hear the firetrucks on the street from my room. When we were planning for the meeting/conference we were concerned about our dealings with the reservation staff - they often mispronounced the hotel name and got our reservations all messed up. However the staff at the hotel were very nice and all very responsive to our needs. We used the Renasissance Ballroom for our meeting/conference and everyone loved the room - the high ceilings, the windows, the new carpeting, etc.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-03-09"}

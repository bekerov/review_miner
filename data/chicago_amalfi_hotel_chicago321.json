{"city": "chicago", "title": "Only ups for us!!", "text": "And two &quot;way ups&quot; at that. We just finished a two-night stay at the Amalfi, and have only very good things to say. The room was clean and comfy....the bed fluffy and cozy...the staff was extremely helpful and friendly....the location is the best of all the hotels we've tried so far. If you're at all familiar with this hotel, you know they went through a remodeling. It's finished, and it's terrific. Very tastefully decorated lobby, hallways, and rooms - particularly the bathrooms. Loved the complimentary continental breakfast, and what a cool idea! Each floor has its own setup. You go out and get whatever coffee, tea, juice you want, plus pastries, fruit, yogurt, bagels, etc - then take it all back to enjoy in your room...then of course back for more anything you need. (And I haven't run across many breakfast setups that have pain au chocolat, but the Amalfi does). Then there's the nightly complimentary reception - wine, beer, and cocktails to accompany an Italian-themed appetizer buffet, loaded with tasty choices. We loved both ends of the day!One last word about the location. It was such an easy walk to our favorite activities - the Art Institute, the Cultural Center, and of course shopping. Never needed a bus or a taxi. In fact, we love to take walks on trips like this as a form of exercise (though there is a very well-equipped health center in the hotel) and we had to go out of our way to make them longer - all of our spots were just too close to the hotel. So a really great stay and great recommendation from two extremely satisfied customers who will definitely return. I won't name the other hotels from previous trips, but though they were good, we have now been spoiled!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-02-16"}

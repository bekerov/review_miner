{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great stay at the Allerton", "text": "We recently had a wonderful 2 nights at the Allerton. We were somewhat concerned after reading some of the reviews and getting this hotel on priceline ($150) but it turned out to be just fine. When we arrived the valet ($36) was very prompt and the front desk was very courteous. We were assigned a room with a double bed but we asked if we could get a king instead. They did not have a king but gave us a queen on a high floor. The room itself was very clean and a perfect size for the two of us. We found the room to be very clean and quiet. I was worried about the bathroom being too small to accomodate my hair and makeup supplies but it was just fine. The shower was spacious and very clean. We ate at the hotel restaurant for breakfast, it was a little pricey but very tasty. The most we waited for an elevator was 2 min. Overall, this is a very charming hotel with an excellent location, right in the heart of the Magnificent Mile. We would love to stay here again!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-27"}

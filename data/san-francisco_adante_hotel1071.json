{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Value! No complaints!", "text": "This hotel didn't look particularly great on the websites I viewed but we wanted somewhere reasonable to stay. The hotel was excellent! The staff were friendly, the rooms were really clean and comfortable. There is a great little coffee shop/ internet cafe/ bar which was great for a quick coffee or drink in the afternoon. The location was ideal near the theatres and close to Union Square. Also plenty of taxis and, if you want to take the bus or trolley, the staff will point you in the correct direction. Our room had a huge bathroom and the room was large too. We were offered an upgrade for a bit more money but didn't take it because the upgraded room was a bit smaller (but it had a hottub).No complaints! Great value!", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-08-09"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Old  but charming and historic!", "text": "We have stayed at the Aida Hotel three times, and it has been pretty nice! Old, yes, it was built in 1912. Close to everything, and it has a great city feel on rooms facing the street. It was fun looking down on the streetcars below! I did not see any bedbugs, and the rooms seemed pretty clean. The shower pressure had a lot to be desired, and the water temperature,fluctuated wildly! Yes, there are some strange people around, but they are everywhere in San Fransisco! Parking garage was a bit spooky, but not over priced. Bjorn in San Diego", "hotel": "aida_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-02"}

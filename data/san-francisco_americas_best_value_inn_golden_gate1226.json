{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Could be worse", "text": "Our hotel in the city cancelled at the last second and this was only one of two rooms available. Definately not worth $175/night. The Good: great location - excellent for walking and taking the bus ($40 cab from the airport). The bathroom was renovated and very clean. Our smoking room did not smell. The best breakfast in the city is across the street (Home Plate).The bad: no amenities - esp at $175 a night. Make sure you check for TP before you use the bathroom. This seems to be a common problem.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-14"}

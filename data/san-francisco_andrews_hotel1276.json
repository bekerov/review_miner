{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great small hotel - good value great location friendly staff", "text": "We stayed in a 'comfy queen' room. The rooms are small (European style), and clean but very adequate. The best part about this hotel was the extremely helpful and friendly front staff and the location (2 blocks from Union Square). An above average continental breakfast is placed on every floor. Try to stay at the back of the hotel -- when the windows are open it's noisy well into the morning. (There's no air conditioning.) While not fancy, this hotel offered excellent value for the money. When we return to San Francisco we will stay here again.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-08"}

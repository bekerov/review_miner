{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Staff and good location make the Amalfi a good choice", "text": "My wife and I stayed at the Amalfi this past weekend and were quite pleased. The staff was helpful and pleasant. The room (530) was tastefully appointed and spacious. The dual shower heads are great. Having breakfast on your floor is a definite plus. Decent choice of pastries, breads, and muffins. No fruit (except for juice) or dairy products sans butter. A choice of coffee and tea along with the juice as beverages. Within walking distance of the Navy Pier and just a block from the House of Blues (where we saw Chris Isaak). Plenty of restaurants around it and room service from Harry Carry's arrived in about 15 minutes at 7 pm on a Sunday night. Well equiped exercise facility.If you drive you should definitely consider parking outside the Hotel. When we arrived the hotel's valet even suggested not having him park the car. It is $37 a day to park in the hotel's lot versus $6 a day on weekends and $24 a day on weekdays at a lot that is 2 blocks west of the hotel on the south side of Kinzie between Dearborn and Clark.If I were to return to Chicago I would definitely stay at the Amalfi if I wanted to stay downtown. (It is just North of the Chicago River and therefore only a couple blocks away from the loop. The walk along the river to see the tall ships on the way out to the pier was also quite nice.)", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-08-07"}

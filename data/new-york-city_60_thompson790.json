{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Fantastic stay!", "text": "Chic, understated luxury. We loved this property -- spacious room, sumptuous black marble bath with walk in shower and Fresh bath products. The continental breakfast, with fresh fruit, homemade granola, yoghurt, pastries, fresh orange juice, coffee, tea was delicious and reasonable. We arrived early, and the front desk was friendly and helpful, taking our cell number so that they could let us know when the room was ready while we were out shopping. Location is great, walkable to NYU, the Village, and good restaurants and shopping. And a lovely roof-top patio for sunbathing in day and a drink in the evening. We found a great rate at Quikbook.com. Anne-Laurent, from the executive office who acted as concierge, was always helpful. A perfect stay -- definitely a 5 star hotel.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-07-10"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "60 Thompson is not a Boutique Hotel !", "text": "I was there for 3 nights to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday. After a 7 hour drive we were at the front desk at 2:30 and check-in at 3:00, not a room avalaible.Very cold welcome by the receptionist that we seemed to bother. We had a king size room but don't bother to pay more since all the rooms are the same (very small) and the only difference is the size of the bed. Very noisy hotel where everytime a guest closes a door it makes a terrible noise. You can also hear everyone in the hallway. I'm a member of Small Luxury Hotels (SLH) and I travelled everywhere in boutique hotels. 60 Thompson IS NOT a boutique hotel. For example, even though I wrote to the management few weeks before our arrival telling them about the special occasion, nothing was made to highlight the fact. Is it too much to ask to have a small note in the room ? There is a very nice roof terrace but it's only open from 5:30pm. It would be great to enjoy the quietness of the place, the view, a drink at anytime of the day. If you need to use a computer, you'll have to use the small one on the front desk, standing in the middle of everyone. The only goog things are the friendly welcome from the doormen and the location.I wouldn't pay more than 200$ for this hotel. It was 400$ + 55$ for parking. Ridiculous...", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-27"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "An OK stay", "text": "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Allerton in May 2008 upon recommendations from his family. We found that the Allerton suited our basic needs for a reasonably-priced, safe, clean and centrally-located hotel. I can see, though, why other reviewers have been disappointed, especially if they paid for and expected an above-average stay.Our positives: We could not have asked for a better location. The hotel is amongst various luxury boutiques along Michigan Avenue and is a few blocks away from the Hancock Observatory. We also found it quite easy to access the Loop as the hotel is within walking distance to two El Train stops along the red line. We appreciated that the hotel was quiet in the evenings, even with the bustle of Michigan Avenue outside our window. Our room was clean, and the staff was courteous.Our negatives: We heeded earlier warnings about the small rooms and so booked a &quot;standard&quot; room rather than the &quot;petite.&quot; Unfortunately, we still found our room to be unbelievably small; it was almost comical. Like other reviewers, also were a bit confused by the various sets of elevators in the hotel, and on one occasion, we waited nearly 10 mins for a lift to arrive on our floor to take us down to the lobby. Finally, on our last day, we received several reminders to check-out, including a knock at the door at 8 a.m. by someone delivering a bill for our stay.Again, my boyfriend and I had very basic expectations in a hotel, and thus were willing to overlook the negatives of our stay because of the Allerton's great location and price (we paid about $128/night). I would not recommend this hotel, however, if you are looking for a romantic getaway, or a luxurious boutique.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-30"}

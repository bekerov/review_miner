{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Hotel", "text": "We were very impressed with the hotel. Easy check-in, the hotel is very clean and quiet. The rooms are clean, and the king bed was fabulous. The bathroom is spacious, and we loved the double headed shower. The managers special was great, and we loved the snacks. We were able to skip dinner. The hotel is a short distance away from the theater district. It was a 15 minute walk to the Cadillac Palace Theatre. The House of Blues is about one block. Harry Carey's restaurant is right across the street from the hotel. The restaurant is expensive but I have never had a better steak. The bar is a fun place to hang out and unwind after you see a show. We loved the free continental breakfast located on each floor of the hotel. The turn down service was a nice touch to come back to. We will definitely book this hotel again. It was a good value compared to the other outrageously priced hotels in the area.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-27"}

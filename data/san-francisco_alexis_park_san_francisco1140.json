{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Staff!!!", "text": "A great hotel and GREAT STAFF!!!Checked into the hotel in the afternoon and all i can say is that the staff there was amazing. i spoke with a nice gentleman whose name was Santos, he did a wonderful job in helping us around the city and telling us places to go and where to buy certain things as well as saving money. I don't think i have ever seen a front desk agent as wonderful as Santos was. i would reccomend speaking to santos when you do check in. the area is not as great but its not bad either being downtown san francisco. just ask for alternative routes and you will be on your way.i would reccomend this hotel for people looking for a great room at a great price and more for the staff quality.", "hotel": "alexis_park_san_francisco", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-08"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Ugh STAY AWAY unless you like having a disease", "text": "* Sheets were filthy and stained with some sort of bodily fluid, and obviously not changed from last occupant(s). This led to the discovery that the &quot;king&quot; bed is 2 singles side by side. * Headboards was dirty and sticky to the touch.* Dust everywhere, and impossible to tell when the carpet was last vacuumed, if ever. * Rust in the bathroom. * Huge step down into ground floor room, which you cannot notice without the light being on. You have to be in the room to turn the light on, so catch 22. You could easily break an ankle.* No elevator.* Very noisy.* Management not just unhelpful but actually rude, and seem to think they are doing you a favour by letting you stay at their over-priced and dangerous rooms. Going to keep it relatively short, although I could continue the list for another page or two. You get the picture. I am not sure how most people have reviewed this place relatively positively. It was the worst place that I have ever stayed, even when compared to the place in LA when a gunfight went off outside my room.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-02-13"}

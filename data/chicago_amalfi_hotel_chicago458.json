I fell in love with the FREE continental breakfast provided every morning and especially the chocolate croissants, yum! The Amalfi is a great hotel and I will definately stay there again. While I love the Swissotel, I feel that you definately get more of your monies worth at the Amalfi since they at least offer Free continental breakfast and an evening cocktail reception.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-08-15"}

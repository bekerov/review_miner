{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Hotel ", "text": "I had checked out the reviews for this hotel before staying and was a bit worried. The hotel staff couldn't have been nicer from the doorman, front desk, and housekeepers. All were very nice and helpful to the many questions we had. The room had a king size bed (as requested) and was quite spacious, with a view overlooking Mich. Ave. The location is great right on Michigan Ave and within walking distance of the bus and trains. Definitely would stay again.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-09-12"}

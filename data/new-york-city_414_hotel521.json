{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "lovely hotel. great value. good position.", "text": "Great cheap hotel. The room was lovely and clean. You're right by time square, some great restaurants (joe allens was great - get the meatloaf) all the broadway shows, the cheap ticket desk is on the same street if you want to buy same day tickets at half price. We bookended our honeymoon to mexico from london with two nights at the start and end in new york. We finished up at the library, which was over twice the price, although great aswell. i would recommend doing something similair. however if i was to have just one hotel i would go with the 414, there are so many other things in new york to sepnd your money on than just a hotel!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-15"}

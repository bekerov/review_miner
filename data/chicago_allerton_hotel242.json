{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great location and staff!", "text": "This is located on the &quot;Magnificent Mile&quot;. It was close to wonderful shopping and restaurants.We had a suite that quite large and very clean. There was a dead spider on the floor of the bathroom but at least it was dead! The bathroom could have been larger.The hallways and elevators are very cramped but you need to remember you are in a very old building.The elevators are also very slow. We had to wait one time over 20 minutes. I know other reviewers claimed that people were simply not paying attention to the elevators but that was definitely not the case with us.We found the front desk staff to be very courteous. We asked them for directions several times and each time they were kind and showed us a map. The valet workers were great, they also gave wonderful directions and suggestions.I would definitely stay there again. I did see a regular room when I was walking in the hall and was not impressed. Try for a suite if possible.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-17"}

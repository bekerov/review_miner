{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Nice hotel with caveats", "text": "We stayed at the Andrew's hotel for 3 nights. I booked them upon reviews I read here. Pros:- Great location. A couple of blocks from Union Square. Probably just about 10 minutes from Powell Street Station, if you're taking the BART from the airport. - The breakfast was nice (pastries and fruit)- Complimentary water, coffee, tea (and glass of wine at the Vino) was a nice touch- Free wifi- Clean- Staff were friendly and helpfulCons:- Smallest bathroom ever. Quite difficult to bend over and wash your feet in the shower since the stall was very cramped. I'm not a large person (5'5&quot;) and I felt cramped. The toilet was not easy to sit on. If you had a belly, it would probably be pressing against the sink. -because the room in general was quite small, no where to eat breakfast in the room with 2 people (you can eat on the bed, but.....)-Bed was too soft, your whole body would just sink in. would have preferred a firmer mattress. Bed was too soft and made it difficult to have breakfast on.Overall, it is a nice hotel. Rates were great. But if you're a larger individual, I would be cautious because it is small. Hesitant on giving the hotel a higher score because the small room and soft bed. If you don't mind the size, then this is really a nice place to stay.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-14"}

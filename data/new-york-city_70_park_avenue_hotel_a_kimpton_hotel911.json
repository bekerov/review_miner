{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "extremely comfortable", "text": "We liked 70 Park Avenue, our room was spacious and comfortable, for B&amp;B the rate (through travelzoo) was reasonable and above all the situation so close to Grand Central was great. The breakfast was most enjoyable. The position of the hotel was quiet and although we could hear the air conditioning unit it didn't stop us sleeping. Loads of useful touches we think, eg availability of an umbrella. The staff were very helpful, and we did need their help! The wine reception was most welcome...So, we wish there was a hotel in London to compare.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-13"}

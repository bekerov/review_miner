{"city": "chicago", "title": "A Train Wreck", "text": "Our stay was terrible from start to finish. Check-in was disorganized. Many families and business people waited as a flustered staff attempted to process visitors who had booked weeks and months in advance. Gave us the strangest room I have even been in. Two double beds in a room not much wider than the length of the beds. The bathroom was 5 feet wide and ran the length of the room too. ZERO counter space in the bathroom. Good luck ladies.Lost the valet-checked car we rented upon our chackout -- almost late to the airport due to their frantic search. A understaffed, old, poorly managed hotel.It's location is the only thing keeping it from being torn down.To top it off, it was priced the same as nice hotels. This was not a priceline deal.We will never return.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-06-14"}

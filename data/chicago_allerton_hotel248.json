{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Hotel... Very Clean Great Location!!!", "text": "Allerton Crowne Plaza Hotel was a very nice hotel. It was in a great location central to everything. It was 2 blocks from the red line to/from the airport, 2 blocks from Hancock Bldg, few blocks from bars/restaurants on Rush St., across the street from bus stop to museums and parks and a short walk to navy pier. The only thing negative I could say about this hotel is that the room was very small and had an odd configuration. We had 4 people and it was cozy... Hotel does not have a pool which could be a deal breaker for some. Overall I would definitely suggest anyone to stay in this hotel. It was very clean and the staff was wonderful. No problems at all with anything. The hotel even let us check in at 8am which saved us being that we had a really early flight.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-05-31"}

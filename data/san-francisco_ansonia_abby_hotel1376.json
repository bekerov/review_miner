{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Horrible", "text": "Sure, it's cheap - but you get what you pay for (and then some). Room was FILTHY and TINY. So-called &quot;Housekeeping&quot; consists of daily replacement of two towels for bathing (hand-sized towels). Dark, small, dingy rooms (carpet at least 30 years old; had huge stains and cigarette burns all over).Cable TV non-operational (managed to receive five channels); no remote (management refuses to give out, citing &quot;theft&quot;).Despite the above, my biggest complaint was with the weekend overnight front desk clerk. Do not DARE to &quot;bother&quot; him; he went as far as to say to me that he doesn't &quot;give a sh*t,&quot; when I inquired about a FedEx delivery from work. Beyond me why they retain an employee with this attitude towards paying customers'.Management needs to reaccess employees' and their &quot;presentation,&quot; in my humble opinion.", "hotel": "ansonia_abby_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-15"}

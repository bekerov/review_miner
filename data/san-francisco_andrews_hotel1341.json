{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Little Hotel", "text": "Stayed here for 4 nights in October at the beginning of a fortnight in California. This is not a typical US style hotel, infact it's very European (Paris Left Bank) in size and facilities. Rooms are on the small side and although there is not much noise from the hotel itself, it's central location does mean that you get the occasional siren, garbage truck etc. On the plus side the rooms are clean, the hotel is central (5 mins walk from Union Sq &amp; cable cars, bus stops outside and numerous restaurants within 10 mins, Chinatown 10 mins). Costs $40 for a taxi from the airport (20 - 30 mins). Breakfast is a substancial buffet served on each floor and in the evening you can get a complimentary wine in the bar or reception area. All in all - excellent value. Attached Italian restaurant is exceptional value with great food &amp; service. Staff are very friendly and will assist with any queries etc. Would certainly stay here again.We bought a 3 day travel card $18. Gets you on all the trams, busses, Underground (BART) &amp; cable cars. Great value for getting around as although San Francisco is small by American standards, some attractionas are spread about and it's very hilly. By comparision a single fare on the cable cars is $5", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-10-24"}

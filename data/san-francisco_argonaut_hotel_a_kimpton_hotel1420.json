{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Overpriced and Poor Front Desk Service", "text": "We splurged for this hotel because of great reviews and the location. While the location is great, many things were lacking. While attempting to check in we waited in line for quite some time. After checking in, I waited in line again to verify that our room was a King rather than Queen. Was assured it was a King. It was not. Our package included some family options and a gift but I had to hassle several times to get these promised items. I would choose another hotel and save my money for other fun on our next visit.Pros: The restaurant was good and we enjoyed happy hour and the breakfast. The bell staff were friendly and helpful.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-01"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Right in the Heart or NYC Broadway district", "text": "This a a great little place centrally located and affordable for NYC Broadway theater trip. It worked for us, staff was friendly and somewhat helpful. This place could use some help the halls are dark(purple) and the staircases are a little tight especially w/ luggage, Breakfast was well ok for continental I guess some muffins, bagels, bananas, cereal, milk, oj, coffee &amp; tea nothing special. Rooms could have used some fresh paint and new carpet, blinds in bath were a little well mildewy but otherwise nice .This hotel is Definantly not spotless but by no means gross . We even had a refrigerator and a huge TV which was nice. There were No Elevator and we had a window air conditioner. But HEY what can you expect for under $200 a night in NYC. We ate at Ruby FOOs restaurant highly recommended atmosphere was beautiful , food was fabulous! FYI get in early we ate at 5:00 that was perfect.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-06-10"}

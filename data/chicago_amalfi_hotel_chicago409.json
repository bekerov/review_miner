{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great weekend at the Amalfi Hotel", "text": "I stayed at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago with 2 friends for a girls weekend away. Our check in was a breeze, we stayed in room 514. The room was beautifully decorated, very comfortable mattress, soft linens, nice lighting. Upon arriving, we hit the lounge for cocktail hour. The appetizers were very good, one can pretty much make an entire meal out of them, if it weren't for all the great restaurants in Chicago. Definitely try the Amalfitini, it's their speciality drink!There is a continental breakfast on every floor in the morning. Therewas coffee, tea, juice, pastries, muffins, bagels, and fruit. It was nice to just put on the robe and slippers that come with the room and walk down the hall and bring a breakfast tray back to the room. Oh, and the shower was fabulous. It had double, pulsating shower heads with all Aveda hair and body products.The &quot;Experience Designers&quot; are great. They will print out maps, directions, get bus/train information for anywhere you may want to go. The location is also convenient to shopping, restaurants, etc.The Amalfi was all around a great place to have a relaxing weekend away!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-11-13"}

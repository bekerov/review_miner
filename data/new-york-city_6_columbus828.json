{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Excellent service with a smile", "text": "This hotel was great for a number of reasons. One of the first things we noticed was the friendliness of the staff. Everyone was so helpful. Because we arrived early in the morning our room was not ready, however, they called us on our cell phone as soon as it was available. They were very helpful with restaurant suggestions. Great staff! Perfect location-right by Central Park; subway across the street; Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts just around the corner; 24 hour pharmacy at the corner; great breakfast spot just up the street. Shower was great and room was small, but clean. We didn't spend a lot of time there anyway so it didn't matter. Only complaint was that they didn't offer shower caps in the bathroom. Price was very reasonable compared to other N.Y. hotels.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-09"}

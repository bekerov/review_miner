{"city": "chicago", "title": "Free bad attitude at Allerton!", "text": "We got stuck with the Allerton on Priceline. My wife and I visit Chicago often and have stayed in more than 10 different hotels there. My experience with using Priceline is that most hotels will tend to give you the less than desirable rooms, so I called the day before my stay to book a King non-smoking room. I was told that they couldn't promise me that, but that they were not very busy and that it shouldn't be a problem. Check in is at 3:00, we got there at 5:15 and was told there were no clean rooms available unless I wanted a smoking room with a full size bed. I told them either a King or Queen would be fine but it's got to be non-smoking. The reservation clerk quickly pointed out that because I was a Priceline customer they could pretty much give me what they wanted to, but if I would come back in an hour they would have something ready. Great.... I come back in an hour and it's still another 20 minutes until they can get me a room. Finally, at 6:30 we got a non-smoking Queen.This place is old and the rooms are tiny. Although I did have a great view of the Magnificent Mile, the room was very worn with torn shades, water damage to the ceiling and cobwebs in the corners. For the money, the only thing this place has going for it is the location. I now know what it feels like to be in a cocoon.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-13"}

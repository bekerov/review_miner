{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Location", "text": "We just got back from this hotel where we stayed 5 nights. Rooms and bathrooms are small but clean. Staff very friendly. Continental breakfast very good, fresh pastries and good coffee. Free glass of wine at the Fino is fun when you are back to enjoy it. The location is GREAT. Walking distance to everywhere and close to public transportation. Will definitely stay there again. (noise outside but too tired to let it bother us).", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-03"}

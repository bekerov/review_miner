{"city": "chicago", "title": "Too modern for me!", "text": "Friendly staff, however, too modern and antiseptic for me! The rooms were clean and modern. There was no extra space to move around in the room, between the bed and the armoire, the chair and the desk. The room was pitch black at night which was great for sleeping, but dangerous when you tried to get up. There really should have been a nightlight! Then the bathroom with its COLD tile floor and no rug, tsk, tsk! The bathroom needed a dimmer switch on the light- it was a very tough transition between the pitch black room and the &quot;runway&quot; in the bathroom. About the bathroom, the towels were as stiff as paper towels. We really needed a local map, and the one they had was fastened in the back of a book, and so small you couldn't read it, as the combined wattage of all the lights in the room was only about 60. One lamp didn't even have an &quot;on&quot; switch. Water was provided- at a cost of $5 or $7 per bottle.... There was no place for the bedspread besides the floor at the foot of the bed- sorry! They did provide a wonderful continental breakfast. Parking at $37/night was quite a bit more than the parking lot across the street was charging them... All in all, we won't be returning.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-01-15"}

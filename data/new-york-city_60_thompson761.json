{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Cool Calm and Collected", "text": "If you want to stay downtown but apart from Wall Street, you do not have many choices. 60 Thompson is one of the best. Located in the heart of Soho, but on a fairly quiet street, this hotel gives you a certain &quot;zen&quot; hotel experience. The rooms are designed with panache, and the bar and restaurant have become local scenes. The service, while somewhat aloof, is very professional and competent. 60 Thompson is an excellent downtown hotel experience especially if you want to hang with the Euro hip.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-08-23"}

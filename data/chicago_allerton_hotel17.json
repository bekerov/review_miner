{"city": "chicago", "title": "Worst Hotel in 5 years", "text": "Stayed here two nights, Nov 2 and 3 and it was BAD. A conference rate of $157 appeared cheap enough but considering the hotel, service, etc it was WAY over priced. The rooms are just right for 4 shoe boxes. on the upper floors the hallways are about 90 degrees. Food is weak to average. Bartender in the evening was the most helpful person on the entire staff but the lobby bar is not very comfortable either. One Star is too many.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-04"}

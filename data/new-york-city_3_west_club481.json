{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Awesome location and a great little find!", "text": "We stayed at the 3 West Club in October 2008. It was a steal based on the location. We had been looking for weeks and could find nothing available that fit our budget. We had a group of 4 adults and 2 children (4&amp;7). We had the king suite and it was massive. There is a king size bed, a double pull-out (that was fairly comfortable) and they brought up a roll away for our oldest (our little one shared the king with my hubby and I). So romance it was not, but for our group it was perfect. There were three closets - one in the bathroom, one in the hall and then one in a dressing area off the hall. The staff was always helpful and friendly. It was also very clean. This is not your typical chain hotel though. If your looking for room service, or some of the other amenities that major hotels provide, then this is probably not the place for you. If you want be able to walk out the front door and cross the street to Rockefeller Center, but you're still budget conscience - this is a great place.", "hotel": "3_west_club", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-12-31"}

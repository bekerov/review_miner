{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "cool hotel great service", "text": "Stayed for a long weekend in a deluxe king size room and thoroughly enjoyed everything about it. We arrived early and found we could check in without delay. Our room was of a good size for New York and the only small criticism was a couple of cigarette burns on the carpet. However, everything else was of a high standard with a smart bathroom and the bed was extremely comfortable.We had reserved a table in the hotel restaurant for our first night and this was confirmed to us on check in. The meal itself was excellent as was the service. In fact we found the service to be second to none throughout our stay from all of the staff and could not fault this at all. At night we came back to the room to find the bed turned down and a plate of miniature pastries and brownies, together with bottled water and ice, left for us.The two bars in the hotel, the Thom Bar and Rooftop, were both great and we spent most time in the Thom Bar which was always busy with a cool vibe. My wife also took a particular liking to the Lychee martinis which are something of a speciality here.All in all we had a great stay and would definitely return.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-06-14"}

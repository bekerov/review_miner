{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great small hotel with style", "text": "My husband and I return to the Amalfi Hotel next week for our second stay. We stayed there for the first time last month, and it was wonderful. The rooms were very comfortable and nicely appointed with great amenities - flat screen TV, ipod docking station, cable, comfortable beds, cleanliness, and even a nice spread of current magazines. The staff was always courteous and friendly. We loved the breakfast that was included in the room price - fabulous bagels, pastries, fresh fruit, juices, coffee -- it served our early (his) and late (mine) schedules well. The lovely cocktail hour with nice Italian appetizers was a welcome respite at the end of each day even though the bar area is in a tiny, cramped room. The lobby is also small, but certainly well decorated and professionally staffed. All-in all, we like the boutique, small hotel atmosphere of the Amalfi, and hope to return there often.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-17"}

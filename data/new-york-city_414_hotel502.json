{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Good hotel in excellent location", "text": "New York is no longer a cheap destination, but the 414 Hotel is probably as good a deal as you can get. Situated in a charming street 5 minutes walk from Times Square, the location of this hotel is hard to beat. Restaurant Row is near at hand and you never need to walk far for an excellent meal or live music.The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Don't be put off by the rather depressing brown stair carpet, its not a good first impression. However the rooms are spacious and comfortably equipped. Rooms are well serviced daily. Yes some of the paint work does need freshening up, but we found our room warm and comfortable. Probably the best hotel bed I have ever slept in. If you take comfortable shoes and warm clothes (in Winter) you can walk to most of the main sites from the 414. Breakfast is included but not worth staying in for. Great cafe on the corner that does the bigest pancakes I have ever seen!In conclusion a good hotel I would be happy to recommend to anyone.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-12-23"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Would definitely stay there again!", "text": "Stayed at the 414 Hotel for 3 nights. Enjoyed the central location and is within easy walking distance of subway. The hotel was fully booked, but never heard anyone else, although I saw folks at breakfast. Enjoyed the continental breakfast which certainly helped with expenses. By New York standards, the room and bathroom were a nice size. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and we slept well every night. When we arrived, the air conditioner was off and it took a while to cool the room, but once cooled, everything was fine. The staff was very nice and helpful. The only drawback to the hotel is no elevator. Also, for some reason, the stairwell and hallways are painted a dark color; a lighter color would sure make a difference.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-30"}

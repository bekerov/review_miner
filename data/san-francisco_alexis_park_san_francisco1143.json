{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great hotel Very Nice Staff Clean Rooms", "text": "This hotel is wonderful. The room condition is above the average. It is a very clean place. The bed is comfortable, good lightning, good wireless connection, and good continental breakfast. The front desk staff is friendly and helpful. I was a little concern about the neighborhood when I read couple of reviews. It is not as bad as I thought it would be. Actually, it is very convenient location. Couple rental car companies with the walk distance, short walk to the opera, 10 minutes to Cable Car Station, 10 minutes to Union Square. I think it is an inexpensive hotel, perfect for couple days.", "hotel": "alexis_park_san_francisco", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-11-08"}

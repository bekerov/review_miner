{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great location - Great service", "text": "Three friends recently stayed at the Allerton for fun. The other reviewers are right on the mark when they say the location is great - right in the middle of everything. We were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go. The metro is close too. We took advantage of the upgrade opportunity we received in advance. For just a few dollars more, we were able to get a small suite. It was the perfect size for three people. Two nice sized rooms, with a sleeper sofa and 2 queen sized beds. Even though they knew that 3 of us would be staying in the room, we consistently were given only enough towels for 2, and there were no linens on the pull-out sofa. But we called housekeeping, and what we needed was delivered very quickly. So it wasn't a big deal. And I don't know what elevators one of the previous reviewers was taking, but we were on the 18th floor and breezed right up there every time. And the free wine in the bar from 4:30-5:30 was a special treat! We had a great time at the Allerton. No complaints from this trio of friends!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-03"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "414 charming ", "text": "We stayed at the 414 September 27 - October 1 2006. It was exactly what we had hoped and expected based on the posotive reviews from this website and a few more.We did not want to spend a huge amount of money for accomodations (because everything else is so expensive in NYC) but we did want something clean &amp; comfy. Since there are no elevators we requested the first floor. Our room was small but exceptionally clean. The bathroom was actually quite large.Each room had a mini fridge which came in handy.A small, charming courtyard was right outside our room and we ate out there almost every morning and enjoyed a few beers and some wine &amp; cheese after a long day of sightseeing.There is a small kitchenette in the lobby with a microwave, sink, fridge. We ate breakfast at the 414 every morning. Cereal, fresh croissants, fresh huge muffins, bagels, cream cheese, butter etc.coffee (wonderful!) juice, milk. I picked up fresh fruit from one of the several markets very close to the 414 to have at breakfast.Loved the down pillows on the bed. .....rare for any hotel to provide down pillows. Staff was very courteous.If you are looking for a large chain hotel feeling than the 414 is not for you. The 414 does have a very European feel. We loved the location, convenient to everything but a off the main drag a bit and also felt very safe.I would stay at this hotel again &amp; recommend it.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-09"}

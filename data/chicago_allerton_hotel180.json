{"city": "chicago", "title": "great location", "text": "We stayed 4 days over Memorial Day weekend, and were so pleased with the Allerton, we can't possibly understand the negative reviews. Yes, the rooms are pretty small, but they were clean, comfortable, and well equipped. And yes, there is street noise. You are right on Michigan Avenue, where everything is literally at your doorstep. We found the staff to be extremely helpful and friendly; everyone we had direct contact with made it a point to say hello and wish us a nice day. Please note; you will have to take 2 elevators to get to your room. We laughed when we read how many people complained about that! Only thing to keep in mind is the lack of FREE internet access. You will have to pay to have it in your room, but we got a nice deal on the room so we didn't feel too bad about paying. We will definitely be returning to The Allerton.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-05-29"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Midtown Inn at great price", "text": "We stayed here in December for our annual New York trip. The hotel is on 46th street, one block west of Restaurant Row. The rooms were standard New York size with nice size bath. I found the breakfast/lobby area small and the food basic (carbs only--no fruit for breakfast). Tables were not cleaned or set between patrons. Upper floors are walk-up and there was no assistance with baggage. Our room had no hair-dryer but one was provided when asked. We would stay here again because the price was right, and the location was great for being in Midtown but now know what to expect. ", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-02-11"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Can't wait to go back", "text": "My son had stayed here for a wedding or I might not ever have heard of it. Per his review we booked it with another couple for a getaway weekend and we were not disappointed. Check in was smooth, I loved having the magazines in the room. The complimentary cocktails and appitizers were a great touch also, as was the breakfast by the elevators. The coffee was delicious, nice bosc pears, and wonderful pastries. My only complaint was upon check out, there was a mini bar charge and $35 of long distance that we never used. These charges were removed immediately, but check your bill when you leave.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-07"}

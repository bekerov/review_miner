They allowed us to check in early, gave us tips on good restaurants near by, how to get to museums etc.We loved the decor, in room fridge with free drinks, excellent coffee,complementary breakfast and glass of wine in the Fino bar.The only down side- could be a little cleaner. I went to take a bath when we arrived and found dark hair(not mine) in the tub.Yuk. Also the carpet had lint etc as though it hadn't been vacuumed.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-23"}

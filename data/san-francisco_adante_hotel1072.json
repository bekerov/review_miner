{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Dolphins on the ceiling", "text": "I was travelling alone so looking for somewhere safe, central and affordable. I booked the hotel on the basis of other Trip Advisor reviews so thought it was time to reciprocate. It is a nice hotel in a very central location. Five minute walk into Union Square, 10 mins to the cable car/metro. Yes, there are a quite a lot of homeless people on the street as you walk back from Union Square, but I never felt threatened by anyone.The hotel is clean, comfortable and friendly. The reception staff are very keen to help. Cleaners overenthusiastic so do remember to put the 'do not disturb' sign out at night. There is a good internet cafe downstairs which is also a relaxed place for a single traveller to enjoy a coffee or a beer. It is open until 9.30.Rooms may be small by US standards but pretty standard for a European 2/3 star hotel. Perfect for a single traveller, but my room would have been ok for couples. I kept the curtains closed as I looked out directly into another window,but the room had very good lighting. And it was so quiet.And there are dolphins, angel fish and Nemo in some of the rooms.........", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-26"}

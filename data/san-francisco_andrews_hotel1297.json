{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Value Hidden Treasure!", "text": "What a hidden treasure this quaint little hotel is.... We were quite sceptical before arriving, as the value for money and free breakfast seemed too good to be true! Admittedly, the rooms are small..... but you really dont need much else, they were clean, quiet and what a great location. You dont really want to stay right on union square or the cable car lines anyway as it is very noisy. At The Andrews you are just a few hundred metres to Union Square, great spot.The staff were ever so helpful.A few words of advice:* if you want to go to Alcatraz - book early! We missed out, as it was the off season and only take limited numbers and they were booked out.* the fruit and pastry baskets on the floor of a morning were very welcomed, as was the afternoon free glass of wine* we didnt get to eat at the hotel on site, it was very busy every night, but we did go to the thai across the road - yum! And the crepe place across the road was superb!!!!!! Best crepe I have ever eaten!!!!!Overall, Andrews is great value for money and I would definately stay there next trip.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-01-01"}

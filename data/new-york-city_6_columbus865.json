{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Nice hotel great location worth a stay", "text": "Stayed at 6 Columbus Aug 1-4 after getting what was apparently an introductory rate on Quikbook ($230 or so). The location is great (yes, it's not ON Columbus Circle, but barely 1/4 block away...not worth quibbling about) with the subway and Time Warner Center directly across the street, and the park right across the circle. The area is a lot less hectic than being further south, but still convenient.The staff was extremely nice and unobtrusive. The Queen room was very spacious for NYC, with a comfy bed, desk, flat panel TV, and a huge bathroom. It was nice to see a hotel think about the people who use their rooms and provide plugs on TOP of theThe interior rooms are a bit cave-like, since you don't have a window, but the lights have slider settings so you can make the room a lot brighter than the way the staff apparently sets it up in preparation for your visit. I'm not sure why people fixate on the dark hallways - I didn't run into anything, and unlike other hotels with dark hallways, the room numbers were lit up.Overall, I loved the hotel's style, comfort and location. I don't know if I would pay full rate, but in the $200+/- range this is a good NYC hotel that would make your visit to the city very pleasant. I would definitely stay again.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-08"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Wonderful Stay", "text": "Hotel 414 was wonderful; affordable, clean, convenient location, your own washroom, flat screen TV with loads of cable channels, complimentry WiFi &amp; breakfast. I stayed at a hostel in NYC just 2 months ago and the experience is still haunting, I really appreciate everything Hotel 414 has to offer. (Mind you the hostel costs $170-180 after tax a night which is not much cheaper than 414)I would definitely stay at 414 again and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-09"}

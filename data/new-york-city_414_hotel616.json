{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great find in central Manhattan", "text": "My husband and I stayed two nights in this hotel in late August. We were pleasantly surprised at the size of the room, the huge bathroom (for NYC), the great breakfast, and the computer available in the lobby with free internet. The rooms were pretty nicely done; modern furniture but a little worn. We had a view of the little courtyard, which was very nice and quiet, which is rare in NYC.The street it was on was nice and quiet, with plenty of restaurants and Times Square just two blocks away. It was also only 4 blocks from the bus terminal, which was very convenient.Our only issue was that the AC switch was broken, so it was impossible to turn off. We phoned the front desk for help and about an hour later someone came with plyers and adjusted the temperature for us. It was overall a nice place to stay for the money relative to some others in New York, and I would stay again.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-10-10"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Still Doing Well", "text": "I first stayed at 6 Columbus in November of 2007 not too long after it opened and enjoyed it very much. Since then I have had occasion to return to it a few times but haven't entered a review, so thought I would provide current thoughts. My most recent stay was from July 1-4 this year. Virtually all of my bookings there have been through Quikbook for under $200 a night in a Pod or Queen room. I don't spend much time in my Manhattan hotel rooms outside of sleeping, so I'm pretty easy to please on things like having enough space to swing a cat and tend to focus more on things like a comfortable bed, overall cleanliness, a quiet place to put your head down and a clean and functional bathroom. 6 Columbus has never disappointed on any of these fronts on any stay. It has, quite simply, become my hotel of choice in Manhattan.I can't say enough about the location - Time Warner shops, restaurants and bars and one Bkn-Brx subway stop literally right across the street, a Bkn-Qns subway stop around the corner, and Central Park as close as you can get for the money. I'm not such a lover of cities that I can do without green space so while I might go shopping in Soho, I ain't staying there. The hotel's own bar is a nice place to gather troops before starting out or for a nightcap.Staff continues to be helpful, and I've had only one negative check-in experience in the nature of no room being available when I arrived and the 15 promised minutes becoming 45, but this is definitely the exception.There's nothing yet that has been serious enough to send me elsewhere.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-23"}

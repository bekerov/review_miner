{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Better deals must exist in SF", "text": "I traveled here a long time ago, but never got around to writing the review. I stayed one night with my dad, because I had SF State orientation the next day. We basically wanted a place just to crash and it was within a day or two of SF Pride (aka like the biggest weekend of the year) and I booked pretty last minute. There wasn't a whole lot that was good at this place. It smelled funny and the elevator was pretty scary. It felt like it was going to break any second. The service was ok and the room was pretty small (I would expect that from a cheap place I guess)The area around the hotel was a little uneasy for a couple blocks. It was before I moved to the city and being a short, young girl, I would have been scared to be alone in the area. There are many budget hotels around, so I would say don't stay here unless you really have to.", "hotel": "alexander_inn", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-12"}

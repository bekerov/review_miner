{"city": "chicago", "title": "Loved the Allerton!", "text": "We stayed at the Allerton this weekend for our anniversary and the entire experience was wonderful. The staff is fantastic. Every single person we talked to had a great attitude. Our room was on the 12th floor - between the two sets of elevators. NO noise problem. We heard sirens from time to time, and some water running fro time to time, but nothing serious.Great view of the Water Tower and the Hancock building. The room was long and narrow, but well proportioned. Small-ish, but this is downtown Chicago. If you want a big room, you should reserve a suite.We walked around the corner to the Corner Bakery and had a great meal. The hotel is also just a block from Gino's East - our favorite. We enjoyed shopping on Michigan Avenue, and went back to the room when we needed to rest, then back out from more shopping. This hotel is right in the middle of everything. It was an ideal place to stay. We will definitely return!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-20"}

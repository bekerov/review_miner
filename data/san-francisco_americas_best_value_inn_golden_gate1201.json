{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Location - just watch for the shady character behind the desk", "text": "I made this reservation for my parents who were coming into town for just one night. One of the other reviews mentioned that the front-desk guy got angry about the price she paid on travelocity. I got a deal on priceline (all the other places nearby where going for $140 - high tourism season and we paid $100). This angered the man behind the counter and he made a big show of calling priceline, because he didn't want to honor the request. My folks are not easily upset and they let the guy get it out of his system and then asked for a nice, quiet room.I went into the room with them - very clean, nice, with a kitchenette. But it's in a section of town with a lot of night-life. Mom said the drunks stopped coming in around 4, and the travelers started leaving around 5.... not a lot of peaceful sleep for the folks. Not very quiet.Overall, the room was clean and comfortable for what they needed.... but there was almost no available parking (the Days Inn next door always seemed to have some spaces free - I'd recommend going there if you have a choice) - I had to park by my house, almost 7 blocks away.For single women - DO NOT travel here alone. That guy behind the desk is one weird dude.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-27"}

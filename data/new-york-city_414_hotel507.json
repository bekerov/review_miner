{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Clean pretty well-located", "text": "I really liked the 414 Inn and stayed there in August 2008. Bedbug-free.There was only a house number, &quot;414,&quot; on the outside; no sign. The lobby was small and included two modern black leather chairs as well as three or four small circular tables, each with two red chairs. The decor was in slate grays, red, black and white. There is a motif of historic photos of NYC throughout the hotel, which was lovely.Breakfast was served from 7-10am and included coffee, tea, croissants and small bagels. The Inn has red and white plates and pretty red mugs (that can also be purchased) for the coffee as well as &quot;to go cups&quot; for coffee on the go.The room was small but clean. Amenities included crisp, white sheets, lightweight down comforter, a mini-fridge and window unit air conditioner. Service was prompt and good. The bathrooms had old-school small hexagonal tile in black-and-white, a white modern pedestal sink and standard shower. There was no closet, but there was a modern rack that easily held clothes that needed to be hung up. There was also a dresser for folded clothes, and two bedside tables. We were on the first floor, but I understand that there are third-floor rooms and no elevator. We also encountered noise as people went in-and-out of the courtyard.The brick-lined courtyard had pretty landscaping and cute tile tables that were of good quality. It was a pleasant space to sit outside and enjoy coffee in the morning.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-18"}

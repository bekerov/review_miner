{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great New York Boutique Hotel in quiet Neighbourhood", "text": "70 Park Avenue is a lovely hotel in a great area of Manhattan. We were able to walk everywhere and we did just that. Grand Central is only mins away as are various bars restaurants etc... Thoroughly recommend Moonstruck 244 Madison avenue for good value burgers and the like.... The room size is good the bed is absolutely fabulously comfy and it was a lovely surprise for my husband to receive a bottle of bubbly and a small birthday cake shortly after checking in. Thank you very much !! The rooms were kept lovely and clean and we had a glass of wine each evening &quot;on the house&quot; between 5 and 6 another lovely touch. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel and next time we visit New York it will definitely be to this hotel.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-08"}

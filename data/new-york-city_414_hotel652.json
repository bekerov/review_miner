{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Hotel", "text": "The 414 Inn was a great find, and the positive reviews already detailed are an accurate reflection of this hotel. It is ideally situated being a 5-10 min walk from Times Square, and is in the heart of Restaurant Row, giving you the best of both worlds. The rooms are well proportioned, and the standard was well above average. The fresh croissants and bagels in the morning were also a very nice touch.The only reason i didn't rate this hotel as excellent was due to the telephone system. For some reason calls could not be put through to my room, but apart from that i would definately stay at the 414 Inn again. Book early as it is a popular place.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-09-24"}

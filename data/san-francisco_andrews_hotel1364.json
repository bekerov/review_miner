It was about 4 blocks from Union Square, it's about a 5-10 minute walk, minimal incline. We took the Bart from the airport and got off at Powell Stn. From there, you can walk up to Post St. and make a left on Post. It's just past Taylor. Concierge was very accommodating. Staff was friendly and helpful. Bless 'em The room was quaint, clean, decent size, had down comforter - perfect for cool nights. they didn't have a/c which was fine b/c weather was nice. We left window open. There is a ceiling fan. Tip: ask for room in the back and the higher the better. less noise. Sink was small but that's ok, bathroom was clean, plus can't beat complimentary Neutrogena bath products. Breakfast was outside in the hallway, on a buffet table. you can't hear the noise though from inside the room just can't be late b/c you'll get the leftovers. they have pastries, muffins, toast, jam, coffee, tea, fresh fruit. served until 10:30am.they do leave a basket of apples outside during the day. this helped a lot especially when we were too busy checking out sights, walking around San Fran, biked to Sausalito. and oh, you get a complimentary glass of wine during happy hour, downstairs, in the Italian restaurant. the bartender (young, dark hair) had an attitude - (hey dude, don't judge a book by its cover. we can be one of the wealthiest people you encounter but we don't flaunt it, no tip for you!) Notwithstanding, we'll definitely stay here again!", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-11-09"}

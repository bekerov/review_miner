{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Avoid at all costs!!", "text": "We called this hote at 5:30 pm and aksed if there were any rooms available. We were told there was one left at $139.00. We booked the room and gave the lady our credit card number. We told her we were driving into town and would be there around 8:00. After negotiating through downtown traffic, we arrived at the hotel at 8:20. We buzzed the door and an older man came to a small window. I gave him my name and said we had reservations for that night. He looked on a sheet of paper and said we were not on it and then turned around and walked back into the back room and would not come out again when I buzzed again. I returned to our car and my wife called the hotel. This same man answered the phone and told her that they had canceled our reservation because we were not there at 8:00. It was only 8:20!NEVER AGAI!!. People, read these reviews and heed the warning. This place is to be avoided.", "hotel": "alpha_inn_and_suites_san_francisco", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-08-20"}

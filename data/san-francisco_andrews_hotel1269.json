{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "lovely boutique hotel...but cold on the lower floors in the winter!", "text": "we stayed at the andrews from 12/14/08 to 12/18/08, we initially had a corner king (203) but the heat in the room was not working properly...the manager took care of things and moved us to a suite on the 6th floor. The rooms are cozy and you have exactly what you need...it really has a euro feeling to it and if you're into that then this is the place for you. the rooms are really reasonably priced and the hotel is just blocks away from union sq. the provide round the clock tea and coffee in the lobby...and breakfast on every floor. overall a lovely stay, we especially loved the free wine nightly in fino which was an awesome restaurant, best italian i've had since the amalfi coast in italy! we would definitely stay here again.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-12-19"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "A very quaint hotel", "text": "This hotel was a very pleasant surprise. It is very much in the tradition of a fine &quot;old&quot; hotel. The rooms are very well appointed albiet small, but the bed is very comfortable and the room, bathroom &amp; ammenities very top notch. The elevators which have been a topic of conversation in previous reviews are adequate for the traffic. Of course during peak times you have to wait....but it's just a little inconvenience in my humble opinion and not a major catastrophy. The one issue I have is that they do charge $10 per day for &quot;in room&quot; internet access but I will be quick to point out that there is free WIFI in the reception area... just a little tacky for my taste.Best of all, the price is MUCH better than comparable hotels in the same area!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-10"}

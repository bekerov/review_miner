{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Friendly service", "text": "We recently stayed at 60 Thompson and I must say it was one of the best experiences we have ever had at a hotel. The staffs are good looking but very well trained. From the moment arrived to the hotel we were greeted and welcome and the warm greetings continued through out our stay. We do not remember ever having to open the main door because there was always a doorman there to greet you. The concierge (Chris) is fantastic and knows just about everything about NYC. The desk staffs are ready to greet you once you step of the elevator in the upper lobby. The housekeepers are very polite and always greeted us while awaiting the elevators. We love everything about this hotel. The only negative was the street was being repaved by the city and it was very loud causing us to request a roommove to the other side of the hotel but unfortunately they were fill for the night and could not accommodate us.Many thanks to 60 Thompson staff, you're our new favorite in NYC and we will back soon", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-15"}

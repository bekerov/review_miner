{"city": "chicago", "title": "Fair warning: Don't stay at the Allerton!!!", "text": "This hotel does care the slightest for the guests satisfaction. Upon check-in I requested two beds in the room as was told I would have to pay an upgrade fee, not for a nicer room, just for the extra bed, this was just the beginning, don't get me started. I strongly causion you against staying at the Allerton, plenty of other guest friendly hotels to choose from. Learn from my mistake!!!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-30"}

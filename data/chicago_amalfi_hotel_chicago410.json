{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great place excellent location smashing cocktail...", "text": "Stayed for 5 nights and have nothing but positves to say about the Amalfi. Its location is perfect, Close to the river, so both sides of the city easily accessible. 2 blocks and you are on the 'Mag Mile'. Check-in was so smooth, we stayed on the 4th floor of 6. Bed was huge and for a hotel extremely comfortable and good pillows too. Complimentay drinks were a super touch and the 'Amalfitini's' went down well after a good days sightseeing. Also nibbles served here too. Breakfast was provided on each floor outside the lifts, juice, fruit and pastries as much as you want. Free paper delivered every morning too. Bedroom and bathroom both large and shower heads powerful.Only issue, new apts being built across the road, deliveries early in the a.m. will wake the deepest sleeper, once completed all will be well.Great hotel, friendly and great city.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-11-05"}

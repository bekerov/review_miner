{"city": "chicago", "title": "Fabulous experience", "text": "Overall a great stay with an excellent location! My girlfriend and I had a fabulous stay at the Amalfi hotel in late October 2008.Three things in particular stood out for us:- The complimentary drinks and appetisers served in the Rafello lounge. We popped into the lounge on our first evening: cheeses, meats and crackers all served as complimentary along with a variety of beverages (again complimentary).- The breakfast served outside the elevator on each floor. Again, a nice touch that you can take breakfast to your room and help yourself to as much as you like (croissants, yogurt, fruit, bagels, pain au chocolat etc).- iPod deck in each room. Allowed you to listen to your own music (and recharge) in your own room.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-03"}

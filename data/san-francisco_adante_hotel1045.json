{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "If you want clean and basic.....", "text": "We have previously stayed at the sister hotel, The York, and had a pleasant stay, so we thought we would give the Adante a try.This is an old fashioned, mid sized hotel in a good central location. The staff were very friendly, and the hotel was clean.The decor of the room was a bit strange (undersea mural painted on the walls), but the room was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed.The valet parking was superb, and I would recommend this hotel if you are having a short stay in the city and want somewhere convenient. It's not luxurious, but for the price it is great value for money, and we would definately stay again.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-09-11"}

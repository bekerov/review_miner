We've booked the hotel directly and did get a good deal for a hotel of this category. Location was good because of many metro-connections, nice area with many locations for breakfast (Pain Quotidien etc). We were very happy to have been staying in this upmarket area instead of Times Square and other midtown locations", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-07"}

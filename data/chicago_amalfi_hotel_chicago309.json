{"city": "chicago", "title": "Simply fantastic", "text": "One of my best hotel stays ever - especially after living in New York (in a tiny room) for a week before going to Chicago. - A gorgeous design hotel to a very decent price! - The room was beautiful and as a large as a small apartment - as well as the bath. - The staff was so friendly and helpful- The breakfast was great (and included) - I also loved the concept that they served it on every floor and that you then could bring it to your room. - Luxury to a budget price - it doesn't get better than this!I will be sure to return on my next trip to Chicago and sincerely recommend it to everyone!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-20"}

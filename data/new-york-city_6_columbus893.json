{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Small but very cool", "text": "Did a last minute trip to NYC with my girlfriend and was pleasantly surprised. We stayed in a &quot;Pod&quot; room which was quite small but very clean and well appointed. The bathroom was a normal size. The entire hotel has been redone is very chic. The hotel bar is small but cool. And, you are right across the street from the Time Warner mall/building....and right by the park. We got a great rate of $125/night from www.quikbook.com and couldn't pass it up. I would highly recommend this property. If you require space, do not stay in the Pod room. We didn't plan on staying in our room very much, so it met our needs.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-25"}

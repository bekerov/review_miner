The Neighborhood is a perfect getaway in the city of New York. The quiet street is also a plus. The room was small , however I am told that all New York Hotel rooms are small. The Room we got had no view which was a bummer, but it was very quiet. The staff was pretty friendly even in the hip bar/lounge on a Saturday night. The outside patio was closed for the winter(bummer). The Flatscreen TV was great, bed was comfy and cozy. All in all it was great Stay. I will be back.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-12-13"}

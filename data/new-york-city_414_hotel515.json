{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Fantastic Hotel", "text": "Just got back to the UK after having spent a wonderful few days in New York. Having never been before I was a bit unsure as to what to expect of the hotel.I shouldn't have worried, it was great. Our room was massive with a big bed (queen size) and a huge plasma screen on the wall - and a big bathroom. We even had a little fridge and a safety box.Our room was at the back with a view of the little terrace. It was incredibly quiet and peaceful.Breakfast was great, bagels and cream cheese, muffins and croissants and unlimited juice and coffee.We had a problem with our air conditioning the first night but when we got back the following day it was working and made a real difference as it was quite hot in the room.It was in a fab location just 10 minutes from Times Square.All in all - a fantastic hotel. Book it now !!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-29"}

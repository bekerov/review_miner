{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Nice little hotel", "text": "My girlfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights at the end of April. It is in a great location, only 5 minutes walk to all the restaurants and about 10 to Times Square. The rooms are not very big but that wasn't a problem as we did not come to New York to stay in our room. The bed was comfortable and there is a widescreen plasma tv on the wall with plenty of cable channels. Continental breakfast is included but this is pretty basic. You eat in a very small dining area close to the reception. There is a small kitchen where you can help yourself to cookies, muffins, bagels and croissants etc. There is also a kettle if you want tea or coffee and a selection of fruit juices. The receptionists were helpful but it was only Mike who seemed to go out of his way to help you and recommend places to eat and also to give directions. There is a computer next to the dining area if you need to use the internet and this is free to use. The bedrooms were cleaned daily and this was done to a high standard. We had no complaints about this. The hotel was quiet and we were never disturbed during the night.  We both recommend this hotel and if we return to New York we will stay here again.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-05-11"}

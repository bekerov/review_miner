{"city": "chicago", "title": "I recommend the Allerton", "text": "I stayed at the Allerton for 3 days while attending a trade show. My room was above average for comfort and cleanliness, and the location was great. There was good coordination between the show organizers and the hotel staff on transportation and event schedules. I am surprised to see so many negative reviews about the staff. I found them them to be as friendly and helpful as any I have seen, particularly in a large city. Either the hotel management has read the reviews and made corrections, or perhaps some staff reported in other reviews as responding negatively to guests were merely reacting to the way the guests were treating them. In my experience, I've seen more surly hotel guests than staff.The complaints about the elevators are legit. They are inadequate for a hotel of this size, with the situation made worse by the fact the the main elevators do not go to street level. Still, I'd recommend this hotel to anyone.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-05-11"}

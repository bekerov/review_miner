{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "great little deal!", "text": "I travel alot in my job and in san fran I discovered a very reasonalbe bed and breakfast located just 4 blocks from union square. I have been paying just 63 US Dollars a nite for a private room w/bath and it includes both breakfast and dinner. Rooms are a good size and they have claw footed bathtubs/shower which is great for us tall people!! The hotel could use a few upgrades ie the weather channel and newer tellies but who on holiay really watches the telly anyway except for the news. I highly recommend the hotel for the budget saavy traveler and for those that want something other than the normal corporate box rooms that you find so often. This hotel is in a 6 story older building that has bay windows in the front.  Great place and great rate!", "hotel": "ansonia_abby_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-03-04"}

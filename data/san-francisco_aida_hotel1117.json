{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Not that bad", "text": "If you know anything about San Fran, you know that everything is overpriced, there are lots of homeless people, and finding parking is a disaster. Those are all just things visitors should be prepared for. This hotel is on a less savory street, but none of the people gave us any trouble at all. Once inside, the owners and managers were all very friendly, and when I needed to switch rooms becuase we needed an extra bed, they were completely accomodating. The room was clean, and we had a bathroom that we didn't have to share. The parking situation is less than ideal here, and I wouldn't recomend it for a woman traveling alone (due to the dark garage aspect), but it is secure. If you are looking for a cheap place to spend a night in San Fran without any frills, this is a good bet. My fiance and I plan to go back there next time we're in the city.", "hotel": "aida_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-18"}

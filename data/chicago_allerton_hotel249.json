I also was told that I had been upgraded to a &quot;Junior Suite.&quot; The elevators are small but I never had to wait for one. When I pushed the button, I could immediately hear one coming.I ate at the restaurant a few times and each meal was great. The service was very nice.Everyone that I met that worked at the hotel was nice and always spoke to me.This was my first trip to Chicago and when/if I go back, I will probably stay at this hotel. It is on Michigan Avenue and close to everything. I had no problems at all with this hotel and would enjoy staying there again.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-04-14"}

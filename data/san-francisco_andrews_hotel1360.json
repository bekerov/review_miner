{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Worth the Money", "text": "We stayed here in November 04. Overall it's a nice place with a good location in safe area-about 4 blocks to Union Square. We stayed in a suite with a king bed so the room was plenty adequate in size. It was little noisy and expect to hear a lot of fire trucks. It's not new or fancy but it's homey, comfortable and little unique. They have a bathroom and a radiator in the bedroom. The free wine, tea, and breakfast was good. Oscar the concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful. All in all I would recommend the Andrews for the combination of price, location, and amenities.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-02-07"}

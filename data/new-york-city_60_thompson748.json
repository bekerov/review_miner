{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Funky cool if you have a few bucks to spend", "text": "I have to admit that I was a little turned off by the fact that we had to wait for our room to be ready (at 6pm at night), and being told that we were being given a free upgrade which turned out to be false. Add to that we had a room that smelled like smoke all night long (it was a non-smoking room but must have been beside a smoking room), and I probably wouldn't go back to this hotel for it's price (nearly $400 Canadian with taxes).All the bad out of the way now, I have to say this hotel has got it all if you don't mind the price. The rooms are incredible. We love the flat screen tv, comfy bed, and stylish bathroom. The lounge is so hot and trendy we felt like celebs having some pre-dinner appetizers and drinks. The food, by the way, is out of this world there too!! Breakfast in the restaurant was top notch. Can't complain about atmosphere, location (soho!), nor the food.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-02-22"}

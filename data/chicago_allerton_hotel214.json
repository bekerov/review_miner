{"city": "chicago", "title": "Wonderful Experience at Allerton Crowne Plaza", "text": "My daughter and I took our first trip to Chicago this past weekend. We had found this hotel on the internet, and by the photos it looked very nice. We loved it! The staff could not have been nicer and more accommodating. It is pet friendly and they treated my daughter's teacup chihuahua like a little king. We had a drink at the bar the first evening there, and the complimentary snack mix they bring with your drinks is a nice touch. The view was nice, the room was comfy ... bed was a king size and very comfortable ... bathroom was roomy and I loved the shower stall versus a bathtub-shower combo. Maid service was great .... plenty of towels. Everything we requested was handled immediately. I like the older hotels better than the new ones ... more ambiance. Location was wonderful. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you're planning a trip to Chicago. We fell in love with Chicago ... what a great city!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-05-23"}

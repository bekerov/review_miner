{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "nice little hotel!", "text": "I was very pleased with my one night stay at 6 Columbus. They had a minor computer glitch which caused a brief delay in my check-in (no more than 5 minutes), and they upgraded me to a &quot;deluxe&quot; room to make up for that. The staff were very friendly and made a point to address me and other guests by name (even the bellmen). The room was small but very comfortable, and the bathroom amenities by Fresh were a nice touch. At the $199 rate I got on ---.com, it was a good deal and I would definitely stay there again.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-20"}

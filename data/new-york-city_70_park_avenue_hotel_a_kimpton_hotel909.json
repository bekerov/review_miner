{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Don't go there", "text": "The first room we were given was dark,very small and extremely noisy. The staff leave the radio on in the room in a vain attempt to drown it out ! We were told that we couldn't move as the hotel was full that night. The receptionist seemed to be expecting our complaint and moved us the next day. The source of the noise is a huge air conditioning unit belonging to another hotel. We were moved to a room ten floors directly above and the noise was still annoying. Do not stay here if you like sleeping at night !I would be surprised if the rooms we stayed in would meet UK standards due to the noise levels.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-15"}

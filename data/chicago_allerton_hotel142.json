{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great location", "text": "This is an older hotel, in a great location however. There is a lot of contstruction going on right now as they are remodeling. There is a smell of new carpet (a strong chemical smell) throughout the entire building so if you are sensitive to these smells I would advise you not to stay here for now. The beds were super-comfy. The rooms are small, but clean. I am not sure if it it because of the remodeling, but our room seemed to be missing items such as a garbage can, ice bucket, drinking glasses. We called to get these items delivered to our room, but they never arrived. I liked the idea that there was a shower only in the bathroom, even if the layout of the bathroom was a bit strange. I would stay here again, but only at the rate I got from Hotwire. It would not be worth the money otherwise.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-11"}

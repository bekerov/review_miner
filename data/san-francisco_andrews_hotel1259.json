{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great and cozy hotel at a fair rate", "text": "We stayed three nights at this hotel during our first visit to San Francisco, and we almost only have good things to say about the hotel. It was really cozy - when you walk in it's liking taking a step back in time, but in a very good way. The room what pretty small and the bathroom tiny, but that's no too important to us. The breakfast is served in the hallway, and you are invited to bring it to your room, which, to us, was a good thing. The rate was fair compared to other hotels in the area, and I would recommend anybody to neglect those people telling you to stay in a hotel in the Fisherman's wharf area, which we didn't find charming at all, but rather touristy and packed with cheap-looking shops selling all sorts of crap. We liked the neighbourhood around Union Sqaure much better, and were glad we had chosen to stay there. The hotel gives you free internet access by WiFi.Pay a visit to the Italian restaurant sharing the building with the hotel. We had a nice dinner there on a random Tuesday evening in February - and even on such a day, it was packed with people.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-17"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Service was disappointing - location great", "text": "Stayed for two nights Feb. 15 to th e 17th 2004 with my daughter. Room was small and disappointing. Bathroom was nice, marble and fun. Found the staff to be quite aloof. The concierge sent me to a spa that was closed. The breakfast was horrible and pricey. After I checked out, my credit card was billed for a second amount that was never shown to me. Numerous calls to the hotel were not responded to. The mini-bar was not stocked completely, and then I was charged for food and drinks that I did not use. The only good thing about this hotel is its location which is great.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-03-02"}

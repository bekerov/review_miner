{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "You get what you pay for", "text": "For San Francisco, the location was very good and the price was quite reasonable. The doors were not very soundproof, but after each day of tiring touring we were not very disturbed by the noise in the hallway. The staff was very helpful. The room was overheated, but anyone who knew how to turn off a radiator and open a window could deal with it. Couldn't find a better deal for the money paid. Our room was waiting for us and we were satisfied. The &quot;continental breakfast&quot; was less than ok but the on site internet cafe provided a cheap supplement. This &quot;review&quot; mechanism did not allow me to give an accurate rating so I would say that the hotel is due a 3.8 out of 5.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-03-23"}

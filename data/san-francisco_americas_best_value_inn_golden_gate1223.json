{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "We were very pleased!", "text": "I was a litle nervous about what kind of place we would be staying based on some of the other reviews I read, but we were very pleased once we got there. First of all, you can't go expecting a 5-star hotel or you will be disappointed. Be realistic!! We checked in with no problems. The room was very clean and was straightened daily. The location was perfect for us. We were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go and there are lots of good restaurants very close to the hotel. The staff was very nice and helpful. My only complaints were that you can not make local phone calls from the room which meant we had to use our cell phones (this meant roaming charges for us). There were some electrical outlets that didn't work and there is only one small shelf in the bathroom. Overall, I would definately stay here again and do highly recommend it to any one who just wants a clean, comfortable place to sleep and shower.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-18"}

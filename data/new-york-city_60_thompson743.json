{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Diamond in Soho", "text": "60 Thompson is a great hotel. The rooms, while small (most hotel rooms in NYC are small anyway), are well appointed and comfortable. Each room has a nice flat panel television, a comfotable bed, and an excellent bathroom. My only complaint is that rooms are given out based upon when you checked in (unless you reserve a suite); therefore, you could feasibly get stuck in a smoking room...but it is not that bad.One of the best features of this hotel is its bars. The rooftop bar is absolutely fabulous!! Unbelievable views and great drinks. As they say...it is &quot;the place to see and be seen.&quot; Try their mixed berry Mohito.Another benefit of this hotel is that it is centrally located in Soho. Bars and restaurants are at your fingertips.The staff is very friendly. They helped me out with a variety of issues.I would definately stay at this hotel again. I had a wonderful stay.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-09"}

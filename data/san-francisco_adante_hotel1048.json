They locked our luggage in a room and bought us a couple of drinks while we waited. I'd only recommend the room as a place to sleep and shower. If you aren't planning on spending much time at your hotel it is perfect. It is clean, safe, and comfortable.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-07-23"}

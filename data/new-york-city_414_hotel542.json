Having stayed at The Waldorf last year I wanted a bit different. never been past 8th Avenue. Hells kitchen is great and getting better. Village feel lots of eating, everything 24/7. Do not get that at the Waldorf end.414, staff not ignorant as some say. Maybe functional at worse helpfull at best. 2 blocks from time Square. No subway but you do not see new york from the subway. Continental breakfast OK do not know what people want. Diner on corner superb and 24/7. Do Sunday brunch. In fact do sunday brunch anywhere in New York. Gray Line Tour centre next(8th) avenue. Get 3 day value ticket. Take someone with you to watch the roads as you should walk looking up at all times the Architecture is fantastic! Scotsman come to New york next year weekend of the 6th April for tartan week you will not be dissapointed in fact everyone come. If you have never been to New York you are denying yourself one of lifes true pleasures, and the 414 is a great wee place from which to venture forth onto the steaming streets of the big apple. Highlights; Top of the Rock, central park, brooklyn bridge, The Art Deco, Carmines (see helpings before ordering), Times Square. You will recognise everything without having been there before.

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Love it!", "text": "My husband &amp; I enjoy Kimpton hotels. They are so funky! We stayed at The Argonaut for 2 nights. Upon arrival, since we had missed wine hour, the bellman gave us coupons for a free chowder and 2 free wines at the adjoining restaurant, The Blue Mermaid. Nice touch since we got in late and we were hungry and needed to unwind. Food was good, service was attentive at dinner. The location can't be beat. It is on the &quot;quieter&quot; side of the Wharf. The hotel is within walking distance to Ghirardelli Square and if you are a little more adventurous, you can walk to North Beach. If not, hop a cable car. Plenty around as far as restaurants--Starbucks around the corner, Joanie's diner (good breakfast) across the street, the Buena Vista Cafe is around the corner (good Irish coffee). Love the decor--you feel like you are on a ship. Rooms are nicely appointed. Aveda products are provided. The bed was comfy and there was plenty of electrical outlets. We ate one breakfast at The Blue Mermaid. Service the second time around was so so. Our waitress seemed to forget about us. Don't know if it was because it was busier than dinner. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and we would stay here again if we are in SF.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-18"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Location-Elevators an issue", "text": "The Hotel Allerton is a in a great location; you are within footsteps of the Magnificent Mile. If you are looking to be in the heart of the city then I would recommend this hotel. My room was tiny but I wasn't planning on spending too much time in it. Because the hotel is old the elevators are small and I believe that 3 of the elevators were broken. That meant that you had to wait 5 minutes for the elevator to arrive and when it did you had to cram into it with other guests. It almost became comical. Ask about the elevators before you book! Breakfast was pricey-$45 for frittatas and coffee but not bad. The prices are typical for hotels in this category. There are plenty of places to eat around the hotel that are more economical. I did not feel that the hotel and it's staff went out of it's way to make us comfortable or treat us like valued guests. I would not go out of my way to stay here again. p.s. the beds were very comfortable.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-10"}

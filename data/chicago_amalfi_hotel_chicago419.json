{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great hotel; perfect location", "text": "We stayed at the Amalfi at the end of August for five days. We thought it was great. A welcoming small hotel surrounded by a number of large, generic chain hotels. The rooms were spacious and the continental breakfast was very convenient and more than adequate (coffee, tea, juice, fresh fruit and baked goods). We went to the evening reception one night - nice opportunity for a drink and some nibbles. They were having a summer sale and our room rate was $182.50, less than many other hotels and we saved on breakfast!We really appreciated the location. We were able to walk to many attractions ( Art Institute and the Museum of Contemporary Art) and some great restaurants (Topolobambo/Frontera Grill, Naha, Coco Pazzo). We had a short walk to the Blue Line to O'Hare and Red Line to Wrigley Field. And there was lots of bars and clubs nearby. Harry Carray's (which looks pretty tacky) is a great bar and offered a decent lunch.We had a great time. We'd stay here again and would happily recommend it to friends.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-09-09"}

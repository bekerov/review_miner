With a stressful arrival, this was not appreciated. In the end, we maybe could've prepared better somehow...Room was very old and was about as solid as a cardboard box. Room did not smell great either. Was a very average experience. Baggage storage was not secure at all, was open to any guest requesting its facilities. Was an open storeroom where you put your bags with everyone else's and while there were tags to place on your bags, anyone could go through anyone else's bags. Was not a comforting experience.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-11-28"}

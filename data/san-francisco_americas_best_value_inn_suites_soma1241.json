{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great place / Reasonable price", "text": "There are quite a few hotels in San Francisco - and hotels with parking area is a plus!! The hotel has 2 location and I went to the one in Lombard St. - The location is perfect and if you wish and like walking - it is walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf (that in itself saved me money for parking area) specially that part of the tourist attraction - Close to the beach. :)The outside is not much and deceiving - Rooms are clean, and big. The front desk is efficient, friendly and transactions for check in and out - was fast. The room has all the ammenities like mini microwace, fridge and cable - there is remote control - stored in front desk for they said that the remote usually gets stolen... There is even ironing board and an iron inside my room. Like that &quot;unhappy&quot; person mentioned about the shower - their shower works - like me I just did not know how to turn it on.I ENJOYED MY STAY AND WOULD RECOMMEND PLACE -", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_suites_soma", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-24"}

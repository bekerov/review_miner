{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great new addition to SOMA budget hotel choice.", "text": "We usually stay at the Best Western or HoJo Express on Market Street (now Vagabond Inn) - but gave this new hotel a try based on price and website plus TA reviews. Great Choice. Lobby is modern and clean with friendly, helpful front desk. Coffee, juice and muffins available in the morning. No staff at night, but your room key opens the front door. Room was fine with king bed, cable TV, desk, reading chair and small bathroom with tub/shower and marble on the floor/walls. Small refrig in room was nice. Pillows could be better and the shower curtain was a bit cruddy at the bottom (although very stylish) - but we saved more than $75 per night over the other choices in the area, so I wasn't going to complain...Would definitely stay here again.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_suites_soma", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-30"}

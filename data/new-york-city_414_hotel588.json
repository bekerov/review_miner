We slept with the windows opened and heard no street noise. Good security. Very nice sized room. It was clean and comfortable -- great flat screen TV! The courtyard is charming. The staff is great -- especially Mike. He gave two excellent restaurant recommendations. The hotel is just a block away from restaurant row and just a couple of blocks from the Theatre District. We would definitely stay here again.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-04-22"}

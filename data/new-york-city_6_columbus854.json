{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Little Spot", "text": "Stayed at 6 Columbus for 5 nights in late September and had a wonderful time!!! I'm not terribly picky, though, and mostly look for a place that's safe and clean and 6 Columbus definitely delivers in both respects!I got a really great deal thru quikbook for a Pod room (full bed) and since I was by myself, that was perfect. I will say, however, that if I had paid the hotel's asking price of $405/night, I would have expected more. But for $180/night, it was an outstanding value!!!Yes, the room is small. But honestly, if you're in NY for the room, then you do need to go elsewhere. The bed was incredibly comfortable, linens clean and soft, and housekeeping did a wonderful job every day. The bathroom was well-appointed, though the tub was a bit small if you actually wanted to take a bath--which I refuse to do at hotels anyway. Heated floor tiles in the bathroom definitely a plus!!! Kiehl's toiletries were a wonderful touch and there was also q-tips and cotton balls in the bathroom--simple but very nice touch!1 thing I did notice missing was a coffee pot...but there is a Starbucks next door to the hotel, so it really didn't matter that much to me. The view from room 27 was terrible, as most have described, to some kind of shaft in between buildings. But you know what? I was NEVER in my room during the day looking out the window and at night the blackout drapes were closed so why do I care what the view was? So it all depends on you! After my rave reviews, my coworker stayed at 6 Columbus the very next weekend and loved it as much as I did! Oh and the umbrella they provide for you to use during your stay came in handy as it rained 4 out of the 6 days I was in NY!!! :-)Will definitely return if the price is right!", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-22"}

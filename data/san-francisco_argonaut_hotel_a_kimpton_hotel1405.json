{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "I can't wait to come back!", "text": "I arrived for a stay at the Argonaut on 27 Sept. Greeted warmly by John at the door who managed to remember my name for the next week! Man must have a good memory! My room wasnt ready when I arrived but that was ok. It was only midday and Im now used to hotels not having rooms ready till 3. I left my bags with the bell desk and went for a long walk n some lunch.Argonaut is situated perfectly at the quiet end of the Wharf area. CAble car turnaround is across the road. Just a few mins walk however from Pier 39 with the sea lions and bay cruise boats.Need coffee?? Starbucks at the back of the bulding.Need shampoos etc? Walgreens around the block.Breakfast at the Blue Mermaid downstairs - 9 out of 10.Free glass of wine downstairs every night...10/10 ! I LOVED the rooms..ok u may think it a tad themed..but the bathrooms were METICULOUS! I love a clean bathroom. Plenty space in our room which overlooked the Cannery courtyard.Yes reception does get busy at times...and the concierge needs more than 1 staff attending at times but hey...I still loved it! I have a trip with my husband coming in April for our Silver Wedding and I'll definately stay at the Argonaut again!", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-26"}

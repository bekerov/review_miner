{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "An Excellent Sport", "text": "The hotel is very well-located near the theater district, with great restaurants and a great deli and wine shop just up around 9th Ave. We stayed for five nights, and had a comfortable bed and good service, especially from Greg. The only drawback is that here's not much public space and what's there is pretty minimal. The little courtyard is lovely, but not much use at this time of year. Excellently priced for the area, however--you can't have everything unless you really, really want to pay for it.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-03-15"}

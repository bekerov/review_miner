{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Will stay here every time I visit the city", "text": "We have stayed at the Adante at least 8 times. I LOVE this hotel. It's cute and quirky in a way that works just right in The City. Each room has a different theme painted on the walls. We have stayed in ocean, jungle and garden themed rooms. Upgrade to the Jacuzzi suite. The one on the 6th floor is my favorite. The tub is a bit tricky so ask for instructions at the desk.If you walk out of the hotel and head toward Union Square there is a FANTASTIC dive bar, total total dive bar, I think it's called the High Tide, on the corner. The ladies that run it are great and the tiny tables are funny if not practical. Also, crew from the local theater hand out there after the show, we hung out with the crew from Jersey Boys a few years ago there.We have stayed at different hotels in the city but always end up wishing we had stayed at the Adante.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-16"}

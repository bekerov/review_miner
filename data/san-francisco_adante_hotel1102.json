Close to everything, trolley, shopping, etc. Rooms a little small, but there is soo much to do in San Francisco that we only slept &amp; showered there so didn't matter to us. The front desk staff was very helpful and polite. I would stay here again.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-11-27"}

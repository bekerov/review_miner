{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Comfortable ", "text": "My friend and I stayed here for 3 nights to celebrate a &quot;girlfriends birthday weekend in NYC&quot; and was pleasantly surprised that this hotel was so lovely. We had a &quot;double double&quot; room on a high floor facing the quiet back courtyard. The room was light &amp; airy, with very confortable beds, which had down conforters and luxurious linens. The bathroom was a little small, but quite adequate, very clean, with quality amenities. The location was a short 2-3 block walk to the airport bus at Grand Central, and a few blocks to shopping and the Empire State Building. The wine reception every afternoon at 5PM in the lobby, allowed the guests to meet each other in a nice friendly atmosphere. The staff couldn't have been more accommodating and friendly, giving directions and recommendations for restaurants, and events in the city. The breakfast buffet was great. We took advantage of the special that added $1 to the room rate for the continental breakfast, which was perfect. The coffee, juice, cereal, yogurt, selection of rolls &amp; bagels, hard-boiled eggs, and fresh fruit salad couldn't have been better. They also had available for an extra charge, hot breakfasts with eggs, meat, etc.I will definately be back!", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-21"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Finally a clean bathroom and room!", "text": "My mom and I stayed at this small boutique hotel right on Columbus Circle. This hotel is small, modern, and had a wonderful hotel staff. I had to upgrade to a bigger room and they were very accomodating. The bathrooms and the room itself was clean. It actually had this baby rose aroma smell that I just could not figure out what it was. The beds were clean and soft. I don't suggest large parties to stay here. The rooms are not that large, we came here to do some shopping and after 2 days it was getting pretty crowded. The location is pretty convenient. There is a mini mall and subway right across the street in the CNN building. Pinkberry is right next door for some yummy yogurt. And a block down is 9 Ave where there are tons of restaurants to choose from!", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-25"}

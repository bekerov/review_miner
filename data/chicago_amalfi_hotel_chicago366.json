{"city": "chicago", "title": "Amalfi Hotel is a first-rate choice for adults", "text": "The Amalfi is a fabulous, hip boutique hotel in a happening part of the city. The rooms are chic and extremely comfortable. A wonderful touch is the free continental breakfast that's provided every morning--each floor has its own array of fruit, cereals, pastries, juices, and coffee. My husband and I really liked being able to bring our breakfast back to our room and climb back into bed to enjoy it. This isn't the best hotel for families, but if you're a single or a couple and like sophisticated pleasures with a reasonable price tag, the Amalfi Hotel is a terrific choice.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-15"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Loved this place", "text": "I arrived at the hotel around 8:30pm, and was concerned about the reservation being cancelled. There was no problem at all with the late arrival. I found the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful. When I got to my room, the air conditioning was already turned on. The room was much bigger than I expected. The bathroom was quite large in size also. There was also a refrigerator in the room. One morning we left some money out for the maid intending for it to be a tip, and to our surprise, it was still there when we got back to our room. Thee location is ideal. Just a few blocks away from several major attractions. I felt totally safe in this neighborhood, compared to other places where there is gun shots in the front windows! The courtyard in this place is quaint, and a nice change of pace to see greenery in the city. There is no noise from the city at all in this hotel! I was also pleased with the breakfast. There was not only juice and muffins, but also had cereals and fruits and bagels to go with, I guess an expanded Continental breakfast. I am planning to stay again at this place when I come back! I would highly recommend it to all!!! Another plus for this place is they will hold your luggage for free for you after you check out if you want to go walk around the city some more, most other places will charge for this.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-08-18"}

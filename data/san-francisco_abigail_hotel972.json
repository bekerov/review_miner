Was in what some may think is a dodgy neighbourhood, but we had no problems. Geat access to public transport. Main issue was bad plumbing- toilet often blocked and had to move rooms once. Service was also very minimal. But for the price we couldnt complain too much.", "hotel": "abigail_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-24"}

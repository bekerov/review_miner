{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Satisfactory", "text": "Took a vacation to San Francisco July 19 - 22. Adante Hotel was where we stayed. It was a pretty small room but we were only there to sleep and take showers. For the budget, it was ok. The front desk clerks Mark &amp; Tony were very helpful. The free continental breakfast was not so good, could be better. Had a problem with our sink but reported it to the maid and when we got back it was fixed. I had nightmares about the noise but we were put in the back on the second floor and it was very quiet. We even had our window open. I would stay again here when I go back to San Francisco. Very convenient to everything.Vangie F.,Georgia", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-24"}

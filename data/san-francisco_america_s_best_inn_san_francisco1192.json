{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Worst Service Ever", "text": "Hotel has a good location, nice sized rooms, well maintained, clean, free parking. The owners have obviously invested a lot in the hotel (considerating its location). So, why after all that, would you hire the worst desk clerks ever? Upon check in, the first clerk initially refused to give me two (plastic keycard-type) keys to the room. When I persisted (repeatedly and emphatically), he finally gave me two keys.The night desk clerk was the worst, though. I wanted to get rid of some coins I'd accumulated, so I asked for dollars instead. He would only do this for ONE dollar. He said rudely, &quot;I don't need any more change.&quot; I asked if he would do it as a customer service, even if he didn't need the change. He rudely just said, &quot;No.&quot;The same night desk clerk refused to give me extra towels. Absolutely unbelievable.When I asked to speak with the manager to try to get more towels, the rude clerk said the manager wasn't there. When I asked him to call the manager (who was probably living on the property, as many hotel managers do), he said he didn't have the phone number.Needless to say, I wouldn't stay there again. Any hotel that would tolerate its customers being treated that way doesn't deserve my business.", "hotel": "america_s_best_inn_san_francisco", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-10-02"}

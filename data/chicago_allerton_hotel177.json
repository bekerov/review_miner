My insectophobic roommate woke up with one on her pillow.*Very stingy with amenities. Bathroom supplies were not refreshed, irregular towel replacement.*Cleaning was not done properly, the moths we killed remained on the floor and on the windows!*Mouldy shower!*The entrance is wired; elevators too. And we paid, a discounted rate of 265$ per night!

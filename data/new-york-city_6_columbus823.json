{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Perfect Location Small Rooms Great Price", "text": "I was vising a friend on the UES, &amp; didn't want to pay outrageous room rates. The location is perfect, as it's behind the Time Warner Bldg, on the lower left hand corner of Central Park.Good: There's a subway station across the street, &amp; plenty of taxis. I opted for the &quot;Pod Room&quot; as I was only there for 1 night, and didn't care much about view. The room was smaller then rooms I've had in Paris...though it was very nice. The shower was impressive, as most hotels don't have that much water pressure.Bad: The &quot;Pod Room&quot; is that it's view is of a inaccessible courtyard...which has a large HVAC pipe running up the center of it. During the night you hear Banshee like howls as this kicks on/off. If your intolerant of &quot;white noise&quot; you won't like the loud blowing of the AC into your room.(I quite liked it). The iPod alarm clock has a backlit LCD which is very bright. (other then unplugging it, I couldn't figure out how to turn it off).", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-25"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Excellent location great Hotel", "text": "After an initial mix up on arrival, they only had us booked for one night and seemed fairly adamant on having us stay for 1 night, despite our email confirmation for 3 nights (from Jan 2005), we were then given the wrong room (2 beds, slightly smaller than doubles), the assistant manager, arranged our booked room, a King Deluxe for the following 2 nights, deducted $100 off our bill and sent up a bottle of champagne to our room, a nice touch, although we would have rather had it right from the start, the bar is a really cool place to be, and the restaurant looks nice, although we didn't eat there. the location is fantastic, a great place to be for shopping, site seeing, drinking and eating. 10/10 in our opinion.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-05-03"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Christmastime in the City", "text": "I took my daughter to NYC for the first time to see the holiday decorations and do a little sightseeing &amp; shopping. We booked the Hotel 70 because I am a fan of Kimpton Hotels. First of all,the hotel is in a perfect location. Two blocks up from Grand Central Terminal and two streets over from 5th Ave. There were plenty of good restaurants nearby, the staff was very helpful, and the rooms were very comfortable, and hip. In fact, I slept in both mornings, which I don't normally do, but the beds were so comfortable that I must have been very relaxed. The bathrooms were on the small side, but that is to be expected in some of the older buildings that have been refurbished. There was a flat screen t.v., ipod dock, bathrobes and if you needed it, an umbrella, which we almost had to use. It was a very good stay and I would highly recommend this hotel.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-12-28"}

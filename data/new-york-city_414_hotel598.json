We were on the main floor so we didn't have to walk upstairs since there is no elevator. The room was spacious and clean. We really enjoyed the breakfast and the warm, cosy lobby. The people working there were most helpful, especially Mike. It was a bargain and we definitely will stay there again.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-03-08"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Extremely clean!!", "text": "My wife and I stayed here for 5 days and we were very happy with the hotel. The rooms are spotless and the body spray showers are a welcome relief after a long day walking around S.F. The hotel is in a part of town that may make small city folks nervous but big city people are used to &quot;homeless&quot; people. They are harmless and both my wife and I walked around till midnight and had no problems.The free breakfast at the hotel could improve as EVERYTHING is packaged!! All in all, we had a great time at this hotel and would not hesitate to stay there again!!", "hotel": "alexis_park_san_francisco", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-09-04"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Not in a million years...", "text": "We stayed here for a family member's wedding, and reserved as part of a block with a special rate (~130/night for a regular room) approximately 3 months ahead of time. When we arrived and provided the confirmation numbers, they 1) had the reservations under the wrong names and 2) gave us a much higher room rate (~230). The front desk clerk, who to his credit was fairly polite, spent at least 20 minutes telling us that we must have been mistaken or booked too late for the rate etc etc. He certainly never offered to give us the correct rate even though he had a record of the wedding rate and we had proof of making our reservation in time, or offered to find someone who could actually help us. When we finally asked to speak to the manager, he was just as unhelpful and was more rude than anyone I've encountered in just about any establishment anywhere. I was shocked. We ended up parking ourselves at the front desk until they honored the rate they had originally given us, but it took over an hour (and probably a few years off my life.) After all that, we did not have rooms together (as we had been promised), the rooms themselves were so tiny you could hardly scoot past the bed, the coffeemaker ended up flooding all over the desk, you had to wait at least 5 minutes every time you took any elevator (there is one to the 3rd floor and you have to transfer to another one to get to the rooms, and they are so tiny that only 6 people can fit in them, and that's without luggage.)In short, I can't think of a worse hotel experience. I recently took a trip in which we stayed only in 1-star motels, and each one was far more pleasant than the crowne plaza.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-11-27"}

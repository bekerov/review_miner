{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Good location nice bar", "text": "This is an oddly 'studenty' hotel, the little internet bar/cafe is great and the staff are young and friendly and relaxed. The room me and my mate had was pretty small and with a horrible view and very loud air conditioning. The lift takes forever to get to you. It's dead handy for the city though and is just a short walk to Union Square. Not the greatest but for the price it was basically what we expected.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-01-13"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Did not experience any problems", "text": "What everyone needs to realize is that the Allerton Hotel is an old hotel in a very large downtown area. The rooms will not be large unless you get a suite. It will not be like a hotel in the suburbs. The hotel has made improvements which are very nice. There is cold lemonade in the afternoon and hot coffee in the morning on the 2nd floor. The beds are very comfortable and the linens are nice. The bathroom is larger than other hotels I have stayed in where the door hits your knees. I did not find the elevators that slow but they are very small. There is a nice place called the Corner Bakery a block to the east and south of the hotel that works well for b-fast since the fast food places at the inside malls don't open until 10am. My only problem with the hotel is the restaurant is very, very expensive for breakfast and if I visit again I would stay in an area more to the south end of michigan ave where there are more choices in cheaper eats.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-09"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Shopping in Chicago is a breeze", "text": "We ended up here after purchasing a room on Hotwire.com. I found the other positive reviews to be very accurate. The elevators were the only bummer. They were tiny and quite often too full to accept passangers. The good part -it was great to step out the door and be right in the thick of things. The subway was about a five minute walk away and we were able to take the subway from Midway aiport to the hotel at 11:00 at night without any problems. Just so you know, Chicago Rapid Transit Cards work like a money card that you can add money to and use multiple times. The machines don't give change back. We also bought the Museum City-pass card (five museums and the Hancock observatory for about half the price) and were able to get our money's worth for that. It was great to walk up to the city-pass desk and bypass the big lines for tickets. We had a great first visit to Chicago. Thanks to all you fellow Trip-advisor users. :)", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-01-08"}

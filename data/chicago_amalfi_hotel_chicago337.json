{"city": "chicago", "title": "Amalfi Hotel Chicago THE BEST!!!", "text": "DATE: September 24, 2008REVIEWER: Bob Soriano, National Sales Manager, Enchantmints, Brentwood,TN.I stayed at the beautiful Amalfi Hotel in Chicago for the fourth time this past July. Each stay continues to get even better, as new remoldeling continues to be completed. The service, from the General Manager to the marketing people to the general staff, is simply wonderful. They all make the guests feel very welcome.The rooms are nice, with comfortable beds, flat screen T.V.'s and recently updated bathrooms. Each level of the six floor hotel includes a continental breakfast, which makes it easy to pick up your food and bring back to your room to enjoy. In the evening, they offer a fantastic hospitality suite with drinks and delicious appetizers, the perfect place to relax after a long day. All this is included in the room price, an extraordinary value for any hotel. The Amalfi is ideally located with many fine restaurants in the immediate area. With my heavy national travel schedule, I rate the Amalfi Hotel as one of the best places to stay in Chicago.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-24"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Wonderful Stay-Loved the Art Deco Feel", "text": "We took a romantic trip to Chicago for Labor day weekend. The Allerton was in the PERFECT location. We walked almost everywhere in the city. I could not recommend a more wonderfully situated hotel. The decor is splendid, it is art deco and very chic. I loved the lavender smell in the entry and lobby areas. Our room looked over MIchigan Ave. We stayed on the 6th floor. I believe the previous reviewer maybe a little misinformed because this floor was beautifully remodeled and it was only one floor higher than the 5th. I have to disagree with the previous reviewer in their negative rating of service as well. Anytime we requested a service or information it was prompt and the whole staff was very informative. The rooms are small, so I recommend upgrading to a larger room. I believe that their smallest rooms are called &quot;Petite&quot; so try to upgrade from that. They have blow dryers, high end shampoo and conditioner and body lotion. Also, you can dock your IPOD on the alarm clock.Beautiful decor, great service, and a perfect location..I highly recommend! We will be back.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-07"}

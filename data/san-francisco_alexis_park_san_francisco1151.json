{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Hotel", "text": "We stayed here for one night on arrival in San Francisco.We paid extra for a Bay view and this would have been worth it if the fog was not there.Parking in the hotel is $25 which we were surprised about as there is no mention of a charge when booking. Be warned.The room itself was large and clean although the bathroom is showing signs of age, it is not dirty in any way.Breakfast was great and well worth getting up for. Continental Buffet but the American way. Far too much, cereal, muffins, cookies, toast, fruit etc...Good central location for the bay, Chinatown and Downtown too.", "hotel": "alexis_park_san_francisco", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-01-04"}

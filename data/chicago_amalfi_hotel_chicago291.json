{"city": "chicago", "title": "'Super' Comfy Bed ", "text": "1 night stay in a beautiful room at the Amalfi Hotel. The bed and pillows were super comfy. Hotel is very modern and elegant in decor. Hard Rock Cafe within walking distance. Hertz car hire only 1 mintue walk around the corner if you need to hire a car. Free continental breakfast on every level, you just help yourself from the selection and take it back to your room. Room had a fridge, which was a plus for us.I would definately recommend this hotel, I wish I stayed longer.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-28"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Way too small", "text": "We tried one of the anonymous low priced-room hotel finders for the first time last weekend. Our room was very narrow and very short. It had a double bed, a hollow end table, a tv/cabinet and a hanging desk with a chair. We had to knee walk across the bed to get to the end table on the other side. The windows didn't fit so the air was frigid. The bathroom had no where for personal items, there was a small sink, no vanity, a toilet, and a shower, no tub. We had been promised no less than a queen sized bed and other standard features. We talked to other guests in the bar and 3 others were staying in the same kind of room. All were paying more than we were so it wasn't just because we were trying to go cheap for the weekend.Entrance to the hotel was ground level, freezing in there. Elevator to either floor 2, restaurant/bar or 3, the lobby/check in/out. Then cross over to elevators going to the guest rooms. Long waits for elevators. The room was nicely appointed but extremely small. When we checked in and were told it was a petite classic I asked what size bed? double. I said we need to have a queen sized bed, we have a confirmation. Ok, queen it is. The bed was a double bed with a queen-sized headboard.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-02-22"}

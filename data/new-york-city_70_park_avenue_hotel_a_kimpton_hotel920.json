{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Best Service in NYC", "text": "We returned to New York for our wedding anniversary and were welcomed to 70 Park Avenue with a bottle of champagne from the management. Our room was spacious and clean and we had a view of the Empire State Building from our window. The bed was huge and really comfortable. Bathroom was also a good size for NYC and the L'Occitane toiletries are a really nice touch. Location is good and just a couple of minutes walk from Grand Central. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff in the hotel, we forgot our blackberry charger and within 5 minutes the concierge had located one and sent it up to the room. Would highly recommend.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-18"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Bad Parking and Lame Breakfast", "text": "We were in San Francisco only for a couple of nights for the Oysterfest. Unfortunately, most of the other hotels in the area we wanted were all booked and we didn't want to pay an arm and a leg, so we stayed here. The parking situation is pretty bad, as noted by others. Spaces are small and there aren't enough for everyone. Breakfast was a joke--a lame little packaged danish and coffee. We ended up at IHOP across the street. The room itself was okay, but it didn't have that &quot;clean&quot; feel to me. It just didn't seem like it had been thoroughly cleaned and I didn't feel like I could walk around barefooted. It was okay, but nothing to write home about.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-25"}

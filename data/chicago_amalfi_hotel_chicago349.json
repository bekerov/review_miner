{"city": "chicago", "title": "Very nice boutique hotel", "text": "I stayed at the Amalfi hotel during the week, for one night, for business and the experience was really nice. It is in an ideal location about a block from the river and three from Michigan Avenue. The hotel is quiet, but not too quiet, clean and the staff were friendly. I got a &quot;kings corner&quot; room and it was fantastic. The free wireless is not the best, but they also have a internet connection that works great. The business center is private, but only has two computers and a printer. That was plenty for me as I worked primarily in the room.They have a complimentary continental breakfast on all floors in the morning and it was quite nice. The coffee was even good for a coffee snob like myself. The hotel is much smaller than I thought and only has six floors. The room is a reasonable rate for downtown Chicago.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-02"}

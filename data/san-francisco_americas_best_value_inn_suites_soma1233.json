{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Hotel screams BUDGET in quality", "text": "My friend and I took a cross country trip, staying in 4 hotels from 4 cities. This was the hotel we stayed at in San Francisco. We did not have high expectations for any of the hotels we stayed at, given their low rates, but this hotel was the worst hotel I've ever stayed. The neighborhood made us a little uncomfortable. During our three nights stay there, we saw homeless people and drunks. Even the bus driver who dropped us off at the last stop offered to drop us off a little closer to the hotel because he was worried that us two ladies were traveling alone.Some of the staff at the Front Desk are nicer than others. The guy that checked us in wasn't very friendly, but the guy that checked us out was more cordial. And as for the room, our window was facing the side of the next building, so we got little sunlight. The room was so small we barely had room to unpack our luggage (we had only 1 luggage each). The worst was the stained linens and pillows. One of our pillows was so stained we couldn't even look at it and hid it in one of the drawers. Both of our comforters had blotches of brown stains on them. They really need to bleach them, or better yet, replace them with new ones!However, there were two things I did like. The complimentary juice and coffee offered in the mornings were refreshing, but they place the same muffins out day after day until they're all gone. We also liked that there was a huge supermarket a couple of blocks away that reminded me of a smaller Whole Foods.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_suites_soma", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-09"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Would Definitely Stay here again", "text": "Very nice room, good breakfast and nice staff. I would definitely stay there again. The view from the room was nothing special but not disgusting or anything. The staff was very freindly and helpful. Hotel is easily in walking distance to mag mile, pizzeria uno, Navy Pier, John Hancock tower; house of blues is like next door. Really nice central location for walking all over downtown to the art museum and park etc.Amalfi hotel showed up in Batman Dark Knight, which tipped me off that it was filmed there in the neighborhood. Bruce Wayne's office is right there by the hotel. Pretty cool!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-08"}

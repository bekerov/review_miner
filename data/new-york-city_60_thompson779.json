{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Location Location Location", "text": "The best thing going for this hotel is it's SOHO location. Front desk staff were pretentious. We arrived at 4:30 PM, they told us our room would be ready at 5:00, but it wasn't ready until 6 PM! We asked for an upper floor but we were told that the upper floor is noisy due to the roof top bar, only to find out that the roof top bar was CLOSED for the season. We ended up on the 6th floor with a view of the alley and building next door. Furnishings are cheap and flimsy. There is no desk area. The industrial strength toilet seemed out of place in an otherwise nicely appointed bathroom. AND the toilet was so loud and powerful that we wondered if we were going to get flushed down with it. Walls are paper thin. On a more positive note, the rooms were sufficient in size for NY, beds were comfortable, sheets were oh so soft, the restaurant's decor was quite impressive with an awesome lilly pond, the candlelit lobby added a nice ambience and the bellmen were really nice. And of course, you can't beat the SOHO location. For less than $200/night I might recommend this hotel. However, due to the lack of customer service and the lack of amenities, for what we paid ($385 from Quickbook for a room with two queen beds) this hotel was a big disappointment and we considered it way over priced.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-10-28"}

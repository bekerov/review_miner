{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Wonderful little place!!", "text": "I absolutely adore this place. It was mine and my husband's first time in NYC. We weren't sure what to expect. We arrived prior to check in and they graciously allowed us to store our luggage in the lobby while we began discovering the city. They were helpful anytime we had questions. Our room was more than we could have expected for the price. It was spacious with a huge bathroom. The room was decorated simply with a modern flare. The location is PERFECT! We were able to walk everywhere. Five minutes and your in the dead center of Times Square. We are actually returning to NYC for New Year's Eve and have already rebooked this great place!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-10-02"}

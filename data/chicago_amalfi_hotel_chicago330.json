{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great staff at Amalfi", "text": "I stayed with a group of 7 and had a great stay. Although we did not initially get the adjacent room I'd requested, they were able to make it happen and we had a rollaway bed there in minutes. Room was clean and well kept up. The complimentary breakfast on each floor was a nice touch! I would definitely recommend this hotel in downtown Chicago, but search around the bargain websites as the hotels website/list prices are much more expensive.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-05"}

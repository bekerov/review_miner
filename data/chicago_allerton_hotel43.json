{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Location and Service", "text": "I stayed six nights for a conference held at the hotel. The location could not be better, right on the &quot;Magnificent Mile,&quot; near the Omni and Peninsula hotels. The service and staff attitude was among the best in any American hotel I've experienced. The room was renovated, spotless, and comfortable, with flat-screen TV, etc. The only problem, and they forewarn you about this on the web site, is that this is a historical hotel. The the consequence is that the rooms, though renovated, are quite small by contemporary American standards, rather like a hotel in Paris or Tokyo. And I was disappointed that there was no coffee machine in the room. Otherwise, the stay was great. Recommended!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-22"}

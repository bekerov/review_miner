{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "It's our third stay!", "text": "My wife and I just returned from a week at the Andrews in San Francisco. Notwithstanding staff turnover, this small, European style hotel delivers good value in the gorgeous, but vastly over-price City by the Bay. This hotel may not be for everyone, i.e., families with 6 kids looking for a pool and video arcade. My wife and I found the Andrews to be ideally located, blessed with an outstanding restaurant and still offering cozy, vintage rooms with small charming (and clean!) baths, comfortable beds and, in general, just enough of everything you need to be glad when returning after a long day of walking, eating and absorbing the sights. One tip: Beware of Chris. He promises, but fails to deliver. The Andrews would benefit from the services of a concierage, or at least someone more familiar with the city's attractions. If you already know your way around, already have your tickets to local plays, concerts, etc., the Andrews is really hard to beat. If the staff is reading this, you done good! We'll be back next year!!", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-03-08"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Lovely hotel", "text": "A group of us, eight in total, went to a conference in San Francisco this early March. We found this hotel on the web and were happy to see lots of good reviews on this hotel before we took the trip. When we arrived at the hotel, the rooms were really nice and very clean. The bathroom had body spray shower heads and was very functional. My room had a LCD TV mounted on the wall. It had all basic cable channels. I didn't have any trouble in falling sleep although I usually have difficulty in sleeping when I travel. My advisor also told me that he also had very nice sleep every night during the stay. However, the neighbourhood was a ittle too noisy. We also saw some weird people walking on the streets nearby this hotel. In general, we all enjoyed this hotel. I would like to recommend it to you.", "hotel": "alexis_park_san_francisco", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-03-14"}

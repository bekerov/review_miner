{"city": "chicago", "title": "A good experience overa", "text": "Reading some of the reviews on here, I was nervous as to what we would find when we arrived in Chicago, but I was pleasantly surprised. I knew to expect small rooms and slow elevators, both of which were there, but neither were vacation ruiners. We were booked in a room with one double bed, though the bed was at least queen size. As for the small room, it was sufficient for the little time we were actually in there. The view wasn't much at all, but again not that big of a deal. The staff, which I'd read were rude and not helpful, seemed polite and more than willing to please. The elevators are slow and a little screwy, but we never waited more than a few minutes. If we had any complaints, the noise level from the hallway and other rooms could be high at times (the walls seem awfully thin), but for the most part it seemed like other guests were respectful in that regard. We'd stay here again the next time we're in Chicago!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-17"}

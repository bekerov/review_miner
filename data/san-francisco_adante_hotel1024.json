BAD customer service.", "text": "I booked this hotel for 2 nights through a $99 a night special they were offering. When I got to the hotel, I verified the price and the nights of stay. When I checked out after the 2nd night, they told me that I was booked for 3 nights at $99/night. I told them that I verified this when I checked in. They told me to call the manager to work out the situation. When I called the manager, he said he would look into it an call me back; he never did call me back. When I got the bill on my credit card, they did only charge me for 2 nights, but they charged me $155/ night! The same price I would have paid if I stayed there 3 nights!", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-16"}

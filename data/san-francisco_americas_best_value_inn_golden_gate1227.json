{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Terrible dirty but free parking", "text": "We were looking for a place with free parking because we had read on the internet how expensive parking could be in San Francisco. This is definitely a case of &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; $63 a night.We were traveling from South Carolina and spent my birthday here...the worse hotel I have ever stayed...but the parking was free. The room was dirty, hair on the pillows. Cigarette burns on the furniture and blanket. Shower curtain was filthy. However to their defense...they were renovating and hopefully all of the rooms are going to be completely redone. We were warned re: renovation noise, etc. Be advised of the above and check the room prior to making a decision.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-02"}

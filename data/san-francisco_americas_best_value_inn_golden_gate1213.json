These bugs tend to infest the areas they live in and can easily hide inside luggage or clothes you bring with you. We checked out and asked for a refund, but were denied. After calling the corporate office, they asked us to submit a formal complaint, but still refused to issue a refund.I've submitted complaints to the city health department...but for now, DO NOT STAY AT THIS MOTEL, by any means.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-27"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Disappointing", "text": "Stayed here in November. Friends rave about it but I had a bad stay. It has some problems. You cannot use any a/c despite hot rooms because they have turned it off - only in guest rooms though! Glasses in the bar are dirty. Barman when I was there failed to make an acceptable vodka tonic three times consecutively - he made it with soda water and mineral water on two of those occasions. Rooms are small. Service is haphazard but the concerge was pretty helpful. Aims to please and in a good area but is losing oiut to the competition. My analysis may sound trivial but this hotel must try much harder.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-12-25"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "STAY AT THE ALLERTON!", "text": "Do not hesitate to stay at the Crowne Plaza Allerton. The location is superb. The staff went way beyond the call of duty to make our stay enjoyable. My teen daughter and I stayed at the Allerton on a Friday and Saturday night. We arrived at the hotel straight from the airport at about 11:30 am hoping to have our bags held until check-in. Much to my suprise, they had a room ready and not only that they upgraded us to a larger room for free. I reserved through Hotwire at a price of $79.00 per night. The person who checked us in was aware of that and it made no difference that we went through a 3rd party booking. Everyone there treated us like queens the entire stay. The room was clean and comfortable. The bedding was so comfortable. Yes, the rooms are a little small but for the 2 of us it was perfect. I am a very picky traveler and have been known to switch rooms until I am happy. There was no switching or concerns here! The elevator set-up that is mentioned in a few post here, is really not a concern at all. Yes, it's a unique way to get to the lobby, but not a problem at all. The location of the Allerton is ideal for Magnificant Mile. It is right in the middle of the mile. We walked everywhere we needed to go from the hotel. Perfect! Oh, and can't forget to mention, the room service meal we ordered was delicious and was delivered very fast. I can't stress this enough, PLEASE don't hesitate to stay here!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-03-14"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Definitely not worth the money", "text": "DEFINITELY NOT worth the price. This small hotel is nice and minimally hip, in a great location(one of the few hotels in the midst of SOHO), but nothing special. There are many, many hipper and nicer hotels in NYC for a better price. The rooms are nice and spacious for NYC, but the basic amenities are missing. We had to request an iron and our toiletries were never replaced after the first day. We were there for a week, and even after multiple requests for shampoo, soap, etc., never received them. The hotel staff were nice and courteous. The bar on the roof, which everyone touts as &quot;fabulous&quot; was never open. Nothing seemed to ever be going on at 60 Thompson. We have been to NYC 10 times and are very well-traveled and enjoy boutique hotels, but I would never stay here again. If you're looking for hipness, stay at the &quot;W&quot; or Royalton. For the same price, you could also stay at the Waldorf Astoria and feel like your money was well-spent.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-08-27"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Will be coming back!", "text": "We decided to stay at this hotel on the spur of the moment. They only had two rooms left at the time we arrived. The staff was wonderful. We were able to get into a jacuzzi room and WOW! The room was comfortable, the bathroom was amazing.....very clean. The only complaints I have are: 1) This entire hotel is a non-smoking hotel. My fiancee smokes, and he was a bit peeved about that. 2) The walls are incredibly thin. I would suggest bringing earplugs. We could hear everything going on in the neghbooring room. The parking is free, however,they only have about 12 spots in their parking lot. If those are all full, you have to park on the street or in a garage and pay for it. My fiancee and I had a wonderful time and will be staying here the next time we visit San Fransisco.", "hotel": "alexis_park_san_francisco", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-08-09"}

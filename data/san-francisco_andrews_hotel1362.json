{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Accommodating Andrews", "text": "The small but friendly hotel is Very Helpful and tries to accommodate its guests in every way possible. Continental breakfast is above average. On-site restaurant Fino is excellent. Located near Union Square. Recommend a front room with a little more space. The usual city noise was not a factor. Family &amp; friends recommendation was well borne out.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-12-12"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Shabby and Grotesquely Overpriced", "text": "If you're looking for a luxury hotel, this is not for you! I selected the hotel for location and because it appeared to be a deluxe establishment. I picked a junior suite in order to entertain friends and have some living space. I was told it was 500 square feet, which is not large but should have been sufficient. Well, the room was substantially less than 500 square feet, with room for about 4 people only to sit comfortably. Worse yet, it was very cheaply decorated and horribly maintained. There were sticky drip marks on the front of the mini bar, the leather chair had slash marks on it, the cheap finishings (e.g., flourescent light tubes) were poorly done (e.g. cabinet doors did not fit properly together and the &quot;molding&quot; on the walls was unfinished, sloppily painted strips of wood).", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-07-10"}

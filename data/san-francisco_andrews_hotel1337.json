{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Excellent hotel for the price!", "text": "We spent New Year's Eve at the Andrews Hotel to avoid going back to the Easy Bay late at night. The hotel was truly impressive for a budget accomodation. Our room was clean and comfortable. (We must have lucked out, as it wasn't small at all, as some others have had at this hotel.) The continental breakfast was a cut above the usual - the coffee was good, the pastries were fresh, and they had fresh fruit as well. The staff was warm and friendly.One caveat about the hotel - it is a bit loud in the morning - bring your earplugs!We will definitely stay there again.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-01-03"}

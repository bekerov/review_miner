{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Not bad- but sparse for the price", "text": "I recently spent a weekend at 60 Thompson. When I lived in NY, I spent alot of time at the bar there, so I knew what to expect as far as a the vibe, and the location. The hotel definitely does not disappoint in that regard. The problem I had was with the room itself. I booked a king suite, and even with a significant discount from Quikbook, the room was still very expensive, in addition to being quite small. I typically stay uptown, and for only a little more, you can stay in a suite at the Peninsula, with far superior space, service and amenities. Overall, 60 Thompson was fun, but not worth the price. Plus, they really need to renovate the rooms.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-24"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Little Spot", "text": "This is a long overdue review. I want to echo the positive comments from others who have booked a room here. I am a NY native who NEVER stays overnight because I live closeby. Knowing how incredibly expensive a one night hotel stay can be, i searched for a budget place that was in a good spot because I was in the city for a 2 day conference with my husband.This is it. Clean, affordable, and just what you need for sightseeing. The place is literally nestled in Restaurant Row (Check out Becco and their fresh pasta symphony...delish!) with dozens of meal options right outside your door. I paid just over 200 bucks for one night and that is a complete STEAL compared to what is out there. Plus, the small continental breakfast was just enough to get you started.The inn will not have all the amenities to be expected from a large hotel. It is an inn; hence it is smaller and more intimate. We had a room facing the courtyard which was remarkably quiet. Yes there are no elevators so beware heavy packers who get a room beyond the first floor.I would definitely return; in fact, i tried booking for Nov. but they were sold out!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-27"}

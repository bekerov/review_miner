{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Place", "text": "Hubby and I just returned from a fabulous long w/e trip into Manhattan and stayed at this lovely hotel! There is not one thing I can negatively say about it! Everything was fabulous from the doormen, front desk, housekeeping, the wonderful bed and bathroom!!!! I did make a mistake and thought I was putting the A/C because we had our curtains opened and the sun made our room extremely HOT! Turns out there is only 1 setting from the Winter and the summer and when I put it on Cool it was actually heat and when we returned to our room hours later is was about 150 degrees! One call to the front desk and a couple of laughs later a maintenance guy came up and got our windows to open wide to cool the place, which happened in minutes! Again, this was MY fault not the hotels! Everyone was extremly nice and the hotel is in a perfect location as my husband and I frequent SoHo and the Village!!! (subway is right around the corner to go up to Midtown also).One more thing...we arrived on Thanksgiving Day and Thompson Street had plenty of parking! We were there for 3 days 2 nights and if we had to garage our car it would have been over $100...just be patient and look around for the right spot and watch your signs for street sweeping, etc! My car was actually good for another 3 days (but sadly we had to go home)!!My photos look exactly like those already posted so I'm not going to bother.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-12-01"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "the adante is secretly in the tenderloin!", "text": "beware - the adante is right on the border of the tenderloin, which for those of you not familiar with san fran, is the inner city ghetto (we are taking crack pipes and prostitutes). most websites (expedia, hotels.com etc) will tell you it is in union square. the hotel is actually about 4 or 5 blocks from union square, and if you walk one block south you will hit the tenderloin. the hotel itself was ok. the rooms are incredible small. they should be fine for 1 person, but were very cramped for 2. i should mention that the staff at the hotel was extremely friendly and accomidating. the explained the layout of the city and reccommended several sights and resturants etc. also, if you are in town on business (as we were), it is pretty conveniant to the financial district. i would definately not stay there again, but for some the hotel might be ok.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-09-20"}

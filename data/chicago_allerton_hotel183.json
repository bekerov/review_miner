{"city": "chicago", "title": "Nice Hotel but Noisy", "text": "My wife and I stayed here the last weekend in April 2007 with two other couples. We booked three rooms via Hotwire and for the same rate, we each got different bed size rooms. Since we were the last couple to arrive we got the room with the Full-size bed. I'm glad we did since the rooms are tiny. The couple that got a room with a King had to crawl over each other just to get out of bed. The only major complaint we have is the street noise. Being across the street to the Northwestern Hospital we constantly heard ambulance sirens throughout the night. Our room overlooked Michigan Ave so we also heard a lot of cars honking their horn. Another minor complaint is there is no public access to your car (if you drove). They only have valet parking, so unless you plan on using your car often, I recommend making sure you have EVERYTHING you need. The two things that stood out as positives are the location and the staff. Unlike some other reviews, we found the staff to be very nice and friendly. The valet/bellhop even went to our car to retrieve an item and delivered it to our room.Overall we were happy with the hotel, for the price we paid. Had we paid their advertised rates, I probably would have rated this hotel lower.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-05-10"}

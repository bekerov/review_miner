{"city": "chicago", "title": "Fantastic value unbelievable location", "text": "Just returned from a weekend anniversary on Sept. 25 and had such a positive experience. From the valet parking (pricey but worth it) to the staff to the guests, everyone was incredibly helpful and good natured. The hotel has good vibes. Tip: Apply for the optional upgrade, which means if they have a suite available they will upgrade you for $15. (The standard room was only $99.) We got one it was indeed first class. The hotel is classic old architecture, restored to perfection so if you love the details and don't mind smaller spaces, it is a real joy. We were twenty floors up, so street noise, (right on Michigan Ave. was not a problem. On site restaurtant is expensive but worth it. With the valet parking and room, it came out to about $150 a night, great for right on the avenue, much more expensive hotels are right across the street. Do yourself a favor and check it out. We plan on returning each year.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-28"}

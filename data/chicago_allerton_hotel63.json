{"city": "chicago", "title": "Weekend Stay", "text": "We arrived on a Thursday morning around 9 but check in wasn't until 3 so they held our luggage and said they would call whenever our room was ready. So we ate breakfast and shortly after they front desk called said that the room was ready whenever we got back there which by then was 10:30. I had booked a King junior suite but the room they first gave me was a suite with a queen bed. After going back to the front desk they were very accommodating and gave me another room which was just what I wanted overlooking Michigan Ave. For the price we paid, we couldn't have stayed in a better location. It was right in the middle of everything. The quality of our room was good. We had 3 windows that we could easily open, the bed had a feather topper which was a little pokey sometimes but otherwise comfortable, the bathroom was very clean but with slight peeling of wallpaper where the towels hung. On Saturday night I ordered room service. The meal I ordered took less than 30 minutes to arrive and was very good. They called back about 10 minutes after I received my meal to see if there was anything else I would like and if everything was ok. I place the tray in the hall after I was finished and within a short time the obnoxious guys staying in the next room over broke the glasses. This is an old hotel and so the walls and doors are very thin and you can hear everything around you. I could hear everything those (4) guys were doing and we could not sleep so I called security. They security guy came up 10 minutes later and talked to them but it did not help what so ever. Another thing is that WIFI in the room was $9.95 per day but it is free in the lobby/restaurant.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-03-30"}

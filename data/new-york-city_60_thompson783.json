The service was pretty good, and the Kittichai restaurant was really great. And the real standout is the rooftop bar. But for the money - and you'll spend a great deal of money - this hotel just does not live up to the promise. The room we were in was so loud at all hours. Even hushed conversations were easily heard through the walls. And when we complained that we would like a room that was more quiet - well lets just say that it was made clear that our $350 a night was not enough to be placed in a more comfortable room.We booked an upgraded room - as you can see from my nightly rate versus others on this thread of reviews. But we were next to an elevator, above the kitchen, and next to a service room. Loud loud loud.The Soho Grand is just around the corner from 60 Thompson and is just as hip without as much attitude and definitely a better room. So save the extra $125 a night.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-09-28"}

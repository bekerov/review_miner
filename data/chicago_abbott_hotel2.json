{"city": "chicago", "title": "A Good Place for People Who Like Bad Places.", "text": "If you want to stay in a bizarre and skanky venue, the Abott's for you. Look for Hanging mannequin heads and a pair of doves that laugh hysterically in the lobby, staffed by an assortment of quirky characters. I've been there, perhaps four times because I love the Belmont and Halstead location, but the appeal has worn thin. My last stay featured dirty sheets, full of hair and stains, something that was not remedied until the second day. I don't think the place has ever seen a vacuum and, though the rooms have AC units, the halls were unbelievably hot. At ninety bucks on weekends, it's not even that cheap. Persons with mental issues, transvestites and addicts seem to live in the joint; one time I saw a large naked man emerge from a hall closet and saunter down the hall. David Lynch would love the place and I've been amused by it in the past, but doubt I'll stay there again. People interested in staying in lakeview might be better served looking for places on Diversey I'm told are much better.", "hotel": "abbott_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-26"}

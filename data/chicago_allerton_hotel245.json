{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great location okay hotel", "text": "I stayed at the Allerton during the Taste of Chicago for the 4th of July weekend 2005.We must have gotten the smallest single ever made. As soon as we stepped into out hotel room, we were in the bathroom. I had seen my friend's single and it was decent. I booked the room on the hotel's website for about $150 a night and I was not satisfied.I did not try the hotel's restaurant or bar. There is no pool. The good thing about the hotel was that it was located in the middle of the magnificent mile.The next time I visit Chicago, I will not be at the Allerton.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-12"}

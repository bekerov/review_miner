So upon arrival (at around 1630 check in from 1500), we were told (tersely to say the least) that 1. no room was ready, there would be a 15 minute wait and 2. there were no upgrades as they hotel was full.We waited (no apology or drink/anything offered) patiently, for about 20 minutes and finally feeling pretty ignored we questioned whether our room was ready. &quot;Don't know&quot; came the reply &quot;the hotel is full you know!&quot;. Since when has a hotel been full been the guests fault!!!! Huffily we are given an upgrade (amazing since the hotel was full!!!! presumably someone who was late got downgraded then?).Only complaint about the room was that the view was of a grotty back of an apartment block (but then we weren't expecting a panaroma!). Beds were very comfy.On the plus the location is great. The reception and attitude we got on arrival really soured things for us. I wouldn't stay again unless it was an exceptionally good deal.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-20"}

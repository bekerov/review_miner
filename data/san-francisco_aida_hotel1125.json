{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "bed bugs", "text": "mislead about this hotel from the start. would not recommend it. it just basically an old building with a few beds thrown in each room no remote controls no irons no kettles no hair dryers. the area the hotel is in speaks for itself very dodgy druggy area with alot of homeless on every corner not a place to b walking around at night time. the maid comes everyday with just one word &quot;towels&quot; if your in the room she wont change the sheets. breakfast consists of a cup of coffee &amp; a mufffin. bathrooms are tiny you wouldnt move in the shower the staff are helpful enough on a good day. place was crawling with bed bugs came home with a bad dose of them. if your looking for 1or2 nights peaceful sleep then go somewhere else people outside shoutin all night and fire engines and police are always on the go!!!!", "hotel": "aida_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-11-10"}

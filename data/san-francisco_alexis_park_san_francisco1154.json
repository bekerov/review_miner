{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Very Friendly Staff", "text": "We just returned from taking our daughter to school. We choose the Comfort Inn because of its local., only two blocks from our daughters school. We loved it. It was very clean and the rooms were a good size. The free parking was limited but seems the hotel staff made every effort to get all the guests cars off the street at night. We were also in walking distant to some atractions and buses so getting around town was easy. We will for sure be staying there next time we are in San Francisco.", "hotel": "alexis_park_san_francisco", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-09-13"}

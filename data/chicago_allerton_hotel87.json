{"city": "chicago", "title": "Allerton is the perfect location", "text": "My husband surprised me with a weekend away in Chicago for my birthday. He booked the Allerton on Hotwire and got a fantastic deal - $200/night. We were not expecting much since everything else right downtown is near $500. This hotel was a little hard to find since we were looking for the entrance right on Michigan. The entrance is actually on the side street named Huron. They have people waiting outside to park your car if you like. We actually went just a little ways down Huron and used the self-park. It was just a block away and much cheaper than using valet. You come in on ground level then go to floor 2 for check in. The elevators are very small and you will have a lot of people packed in each one, but they are not slow - just a lot of stops. We were on the 15th floor and you can see the Sears/Hancock Tower from there. We ate dinner at Ditka's (near the Tower) and had awesome prime rib and filet. The bar side is pretty noisy. We wished they would have put us on the other side but the food was so good, we didn't mind.You can walk to Navy Pier from the hotel (a looong walk) but we did it. We had gorgeous weather so we wanted to take advantage of it. They have a huge ferris wheel, mini golf, and tons of food stands. I would have loved to ride the ferris wheel but had no luck talking my husband into it.We had a &quot;standard&quot; room and it was quite small We were next to the elevators so I don't know if they are all that small. We could not walk around the bed because there was no room. I had to crawl over from the other side. The size was fine since we didn't spend much time in there. The bed was super comfy, they had a sitting chair and a desk and chair. The bathrooms were great - only issue was nowhere to put toiletries. (A man would be fine!!).We would definitely return. The location was the best thing for this hotel. As soon as you are on the street, you're right in the middle of all the action.Breakfast was fantastic at the restaurant downstairs. The belgian waffles were worth the trip alone.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-06"}

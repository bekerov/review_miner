{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Good value for price the area is so-so", "text": "Rooms were very nice and clean, free parking (though limited capacity), basic-only breakfast (in-room only), 10 minutes walk to Union square, 10 minutes walk to California cable car line. I did not like the area of the motel: many homeless, some are bothering. Overall I'd recommend this place, though I may look for another one, better located, next time.", "hotel": "alexis_park_san_francisco", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-10-27"}

The rooms were quiet and the beds and linen were very good. Parking is $40 but 25% discount if you have a hybrid. At the rental desk you get another discoun for Hybrids so a good deal there as well.  We booked an inside room but they upgraded us to an outside room and had a partial view of the Golden Gate bridge,", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-17"}

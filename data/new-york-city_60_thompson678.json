{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great location average hotel - stay if you get a rate", "text": "The hotel has a great location and the staff are friendly and helpful, rooms pretty clean (although we needed to open the windows in December to let some fresh air in as it was pretty stale when we arrived). Then there was a leak from the room above and we had to move to another room. The reception rooms are a bit dingy. Overall, if you can get a good rate, it is worth staying here, but doesn't feel like it is worth the full price.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-04"}

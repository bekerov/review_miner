{"city": "chicago", "title": "Some unique touches but not the customer service", "text": "As previous poster stated, the website makes you feel as though you will be at a better than Disneyworld customer service site, which this is not. The customer service is fine, but not anything to write home about. I wasn't greeted at the door the first time I entered or anytime I exited or entered again, but I had no problem with that. Just average service. The breakfast was so nice being on its own floor, so you can go to it in your robe and back to your room, without may seeing you. The sheets are great, nice and soft and not hotel white!! Neither are the towels! I thought that was good. 2 showerheads and a very nice location.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-09-13"}

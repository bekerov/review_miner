{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "A Great Experience", "text": "We just returned from a 5 day break at 60 Thompson. Last year we stayed at the Hudson where I can testify that the rooms are really, really small. You coudn't swing a cat in them let alone store your luggage! You get what you pay for I know but the rooms at 60 Thompson were great (We paid $290 dollars a night). Rooms were large, spacious with a great bathroom - all in all a pleasure to stay in. The location of the hotel couldn't be better for being in the heart of it and wandering around trying all the local bars, restaurants and shopping without having to rely on cabs or the subway. I also thought the decor was in line with what you would expect of a luxury 4* plus hotel. It was very tastefully furnished in a dark wood/oriental style with great design touches such as the 60's Ericofons everywhere and gorgeous floral displays. We had plenty of Mojitos in Thom's Bar and up on the roof terrace as the weather was HOT. We also dined at Kittichai more than once - the monkfish curry was amazing! All in all the service was great and friendly enough for us. The only downside I thought was that because the general public visit the bars as much as the residents, on 2 or 3 nights of our stay the roof terrace and/or Thom's Bar were closed for Private Parties leaving hotel guests to sit and drink in the foyer. They may have opened up later but we didn't wait around to find out. All in all though, a great place in the heart of Soho and I would recommend a short break here.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-08-24"}

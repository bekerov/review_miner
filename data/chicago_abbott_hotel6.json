{"city": "chicago", "title": "ground control to major Tom", "text": "Having been to well over 120 countries and very well traveled, It is not the Ritz and does not claim to be, It is very well located among various places to eat, the new grill on the conner being my first choice, It is a place that is whatever you make it, they could do better on leaving more towels and such in the room, however the young woman at the front desk Sparky makes up for it, she was very, helpful and gave the place a certain flair,I do not sleep much when I travel so a place to through down the bags and return to nap before heading out in to the woundeful mystical world called the city of Chicago, The Abbott is the last strong hold of days that have long passed, everything around it has be turned into a fancy shop or hip club, it is a stone beast that refusses to give up and be mad a-new, it is just what it is and that is what gives it, its beauty and strenght if the walls could talk it would speak of broken dreams, passers in the night on their journey to some other place, young people seeking the power and engery of the city for a night or a weekend, the old recalling their first trip to the big city, their first job enterview coming from a small town, the things they have seen and done some they wish to speak of others they do not, however this place to me is a becaon of engery that gives me power to write and reflect and relax, for a short time, all one must do is open the window to take in the sights and sounds of the city, the calling of police and emergency vechiles on their way to save and protect, the sounds of the people out on the town for the night, , it is a place that I hope shall never be taken away from the heart beat of the city, just know that it is not where you stay it is what you make of it and take from the experience so I say for the dollar amount and where it is at it can be fine, just be aware and know that it is not the ritz carlton but has its own flair and charcter........

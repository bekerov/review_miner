{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Andrews Hotel a great place to stay in SF", "text": "Stayed 3 nights in SF at the Andrews. Great value given the location, 2 blocks from Union Square. Stayed in the Corner King, nice cross breeze (no A/C). Tiny bathroom. No problem for me, but if you are taller than 5'5, it might be an issue. Nice breakafst, hot coffee/tea, juice, fruit and pastries. Overall a an excellent place to stay. It's not luxurious, but it is very comfortable and charming, the staff is helpful and you can't beat the location.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-03"}

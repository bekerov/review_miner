Horrible room!!", "text": "My wife and I arrived the evening of June 13th only to find a hole in the ceiling of our room with water dripping from it. I went to the front desk to inform them of this and request another room. I was told flat out in a very rude tone that no more rooms were available and if I didn't want that room I should go somewhere else. I was also told that, for the rate I was paying, what did I expect!! Unbelievable!! I told them that the room was totally unacceptable and, since it was late and we didn't know the area at all, I asked if they would help us find another room. I was immediately told a flat out NO and that we should leave in a very rude tone again. After a very brief shouting match concerning their totaly lack of customer service, we left. Fortunately, we found an excellent room at the Chelsea Inn just a couple of blocks from where we started. They had fantasic large rooms and unbelievable Customer Service at only a few dollars more than the dingy, dirty Alpha Inn and Suites. Finally, we ended up getting a refund thru AOL@Travelocity after they called the Alpha Inn and Suites to confirm our complaint....", "hotel": "alpha_inn_and_suites_san_francisco", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-25"}

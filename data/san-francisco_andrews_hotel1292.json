{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Small but cozy", "text": "The Andrews Hotel has really friendly staff and lots of character. It is in a good location, just 2 blocks off Union Square. It is really cute and historic, with an excellent restaurant just off the lobby. They even offer a free glass of wine to those who stay at the hotel each day! I stayed with a friend from graduate school, who was 8 months pregnant. So, the small room, which would have been perfectly fine for 1 person or even a couple, was a little cramped for us. The bathroom was probably about the smallest I've ever seen, but everything was impeccably clean and very comfortable, despite the small size. We stayed on the 6th floor facing the back of the building, and although we did hear street noise, it was never annoying or loud.I'd definitely recommend this hotel, especially for solo travelers or couples just spending a couple days in the city.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-23"}

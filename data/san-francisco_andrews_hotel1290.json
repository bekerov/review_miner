{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Charming all round", "text": "This lived up to all the reviews I had read before booking it, and if you are looking for something a little different to the usual drab chain hotel decor then I would recommend it.The staff could not have been more welcoming, the rooms were very quaint and reasonably priced and the location made for a great few days exploring the city.Minor complaint was that there was no fridge in the room, but that would be seriously nitpicking as I thoroughly enjoyed this stay in a very charming and nicely decorated place. Free internet in the rooms was a bonus, and good idea having the breakfast on each floor, albeit it just a pastry and a coffee.A lot of love and thought has clearly been put in to this hotel, and I would recommend this as an excellent value base for anyone exploring this wonderful city.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-15"}

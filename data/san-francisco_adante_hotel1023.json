The worst is Breakfast : you're in the lobby, almost no chair, no table, 1 coffee machine, a few slices of bread, a few muffins, and that's it. People in the streets around are rather strange (many homeless, mad people, bad looking guys, ...). If you use the valet service for your car, wait at least 15 minutes though the cark park is only 300 feet off the hotel.

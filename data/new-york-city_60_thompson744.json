We usually stay at a different place each time, Soho Grand, Righa Royale. This was the first time at 60 Thompson. We paid $299/nt for a King Deluxe (room #83)... Room was of a decent size (for NYC &quot;boutique) with enough room for a sofa with coffee table, lounge chair and work desk... Great bathroom (though no bath tub). Good size and very clean. Overall, everything was super clean and well kept...Staff was great. Professional, courteous, yet approachable and &quot;real&quot;. Not pulling a muscle to push that 'elite' vibe...Location is perfect. In the middle of SOHO on a quiet block...Both the restaurant (Kittichai) and 2nd floor bar were top notch. Restaurant was actually very reasonably priced, can't say the same for the bar, but both delivered great experiences...Overall, we will stay there each time we go to the city. I was just very comfortable with every aspect of the stay. Unlike lots of boutique hotels nowadays that deliver an inconsistent experience, 60 Thompson pulled it off...", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-04"}

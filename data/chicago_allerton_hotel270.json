{"city": "chicago", "title": "Good for Business Travel", "text": "My wife stayed with me here while I was on business. There was much to like-- the location is excellent, the concierge was extremely helpful and the room was quiet. I asked for a room that was quiet and had a good view -- I got one of the two. My room was quiet, but looked out on a fire escape. When my wife and I were looking for a quick, casual, but nice dinner (a difficult combination) the concierge sent us to just the right place and got us to the head of the long line. For the business traveller the services were OK. Free high-speed internet (faster than my cable modem) was a plus. Only negatives were the broken sink faucet and toilet that never quite flushed right. If you're going to be busy in Chicago anyway, this is a decent combination of good price and location.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-04-02"}

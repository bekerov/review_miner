{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Loved the Andrews!", "text": "My sister and I stayed here for 5 nights recently. We had a great first trip to San Francisco and would definitely return to the Andrews Hotel. Found this hotel by just googling and am so happy we found it! The included breakfast was tasty and very convenient...just walk outside your room and grab coffee/tea/muffins/pastries. The complimentary wine hour was a great way to chat with other guests and nice bar tenders who always had a good suggestion for dinner. The room was very clean and quiet. We never had any trouble falling asleep...we were on the 5th floor. The flat screen tv was super also...we enjoyed it while drinking our coffee in the morning. The hotel staff was very helpful and full of good info....we asked them at least one question every morning before heading out and they were always nice and right on with directions/suggestions. We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice, affordable, comfortable (the beds and pillows were great!), cute hotel within walking disance to everything.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-05"}

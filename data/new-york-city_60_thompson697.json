{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Loved 60 Thompson", "text": "I thought this boutique hotel was great. Please take into account that I love boutique hotels and made it a mini hobby to stay at as many as I can. I stayed in the Standard Room and I really enjoyed my stay. The Front Desk was great. I arrived early but there were no rooms ready so while I was off eating lunch, they called me and told me they checked me in (it was around noon) and they were ready for me. Also they gave me advice on reserving a table at the rooftop bar so I wouldn't be left standing if I didn't want to. Sadly, it was a breezy NYC summer night so it made the rooftop bar not so great. The amenities were awesome. They were by fresh. The bathroom was fine. Water pressure isn't that great but not a problem. They turndown your beds daily and leave a brownie from The Fat Witch which is one of my fave brownie places in NYC. They offer at turndown to fill your ice bucket, etc. Yes, the room is small. The smallest out of all the NYC hotels I've been to up to that point, but I usually get rooms with 2 double beds, so the comparison is still difficult. This was the beginning of my boutique hotel endeavors and the one I stayed at prior to this was Bryant Park. I enjoyed 60 THompson much better and I'm really a downtown girl rather than uptown so this fit me needs perfectly. Since the bar is on the 2nd floor, it can possibly be noisy, but I think I was on the 11th floor or what not. So it was quiet and peaceful for me. I was also in the room right next to the elevator and never found it to be a problem.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-01-10"}

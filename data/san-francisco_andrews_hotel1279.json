{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great home base for exploring SF", "text": "My husband and I recently had a very pleasant three night (Wed-Thurs-Fri) stay at the Andrews. Great location, just a few blocks west of Union Square. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful; the main lobby is small but comfortable, with daily newspapers and coffee and tea available all day (and wine at night). I had read that the street traffic can be loud at night so I requested an upper-floor room; they accomodated us with a cozy Queen on the 7th floor. The room was, again, small but comfortable, and clean. Very comfy bed. Our bathroom was actually quite spacious with a great shower. Breakfast is available on each floor every morning and this was really convenient (and yummy-- fruit, muffins, croissants, coffe/tea/OJ). The only thing the room needed was a small table to eat at. The front desk has a great selection of DVDs you can borrow to play on your flat screen TV in the room, which was a nice option to consider when we arrived back in the room at night, exhausted after walking up and down all those hills all day. :)Finally, the attached restaurant, Fino, is really excellent and highly recommended-- we had a great dinner there our last night.I would definitely stay at the Andrews again, and certainly recommend it!", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-28"}

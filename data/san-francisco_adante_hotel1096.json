{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Something's fishy at the Adante", "text": "I stayed here for three nights in April 2005. Booked a &quot;king suite&quot; which was supposed to have two rooms plus bath. Instead, had one room that was approximately 4 feet wider and 2 feet longer than a king-sized bed. The dresser drawers could not be opened fully as they hit the bed. Very noisy, facing Geary Street. No a/c. When we checked in, hotel said the room I had requested (been promised??) was already in use. Nice bathroom with jacuzzi tub, though very noisy fan made it unpleasant. No closet, just a place to hang clothes. Not perfectly clean but not terrible. We visited friends who were staying at the Adagio which was much nicer. There are a couple of other hotels along Geary that also looked worth checking out. Try the Savoy, it looked fun. The fish murals are pretty funky. The location of this hotel was great, the little cafe off the lobby was nice, the staff was pleasant though unwilling to move me. Reminded me a bit of European hostels.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-04-29"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "414 was perfect for us", "text": "My mister, two cousins and I just returned from a ladies' trip to New York where we stayed at the 414 Hotel on 46th Street in Hell's Kitchen. I had researched dozens of hotels before reading about this small hotel in a travel magazine. It was perfect for us. We loved the location. We walked to Central Park, the Empire State Building, Times Square all the restaurants and the Broadway shows. The rooms are basic but clean. The staff is wonderful. They are helpful and friendly. Cereal, rolls, juice and coffee are served in the morning and there is a computer available in the lobby for customer use. This is not a luxury hotel and the price reflects that. There is no elevator and the stairs seem steep after a long day of touring. However, if you are looking for good value in a convenient, safe neighborhood, check 414 out. Oh, and Amy's Bread is right down the street. This will become a habit.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-02"}

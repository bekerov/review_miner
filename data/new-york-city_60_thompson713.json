The rooms are fantastic and we felt thoroughly spoilt by thehotel surroundings and great staff. Having travelled to many other hotels around the globe I think we can safely say that this was our favourite hotel and we we'd love to stay here again if we visit New York again in the future.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-16"}

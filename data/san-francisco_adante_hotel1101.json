{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Do you like parrots?", "text": "Rooms were clean, bathrooms were clean and roomy, decor was cute (if you like birds). Hotel was within easy walking distance of Union Square and Chinatown in downtown San Fran. Not the safest neighborhood to walk around in at night, but not terrible, either. I stayed with three other girls (20 years old), and we didn't feel too uncomfortable. Definetely recommend to someone who is looking for a cheap place to stay in a good central location.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-01-10"}

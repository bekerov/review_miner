{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "EXCELLENT but worn around the edges!!", "text": "Excellent location with good shopping and restaurants all within short walking distance. It's easy to get cabs and feels safe. The hotel itself is a bit of a destination for party people, so request a room on a high floor to avoid the noise from the bar and restaurant.. or prepare to party!! we we're moved after a simple call to reception. The rooms are small and a little worn and tired, but have everything, including an expensive mini bar with everything including sex aids!!! The staff are friendly, polite and efficient, which is a real bonus for a trendy boutique hotel in NYC! We would definitely go back.The restaurant is very good.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-24"}

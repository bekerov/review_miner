{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Location", "text": "The best thing about the Allerton is the location. It is within walking distance to shopping, major attractions and restaurants and clubs. I only had to take public transportation once to get to the Navy Pier but even the bus stop was only 3 or 4 blocks away.My room was a &quot;petite bedroom&quot; which as the name implies was small. I was traveling alone so it was fine for me but it would probably be tight for a couple. The furnishings were sleek and modern. I loved the flat screen TV but I did miss not having dresser drawers to put my things in. For those who like to work out, the fitness room was pretty decent. It had several treadmills, elliptical machines and stationary bikes as well as a variety of weights and weight machines. A bowl of apples was provided so I grabbed one to have as a snack later in the day.All in all, I had a pleasant stay at the Allerton and would recommend it to other travelers. Just do some homework and try to get the best rate you can. I used quickbook but expedia or hotels.com offered comparable deals.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-29"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great hotel excellent location extremelly friendlly staff", "text": "We stayed in this hotel 5 nights as part of our honeymoon and we had one of our best times in NYC. Usually NYC hotels offer either small and old rooms, or big and old rooms. This case was totally new and refreshing. The 6 Columbus is a small boutique hotel in the middle of Manhattan offering modern and comfortable rooms, combined with friendlly and professional staff. The first thing we liked about the hotel is that, as honeymooners, they upgraded our room to a Studio Suite. We got a room on the 10th floor. It was a spacious room, with a big bathroom full of &quot;goodies&quot;. I must say that the bed is one of the best I've ever slept on. The area is excellent. The nearest subway is across the street, the park is two minutes away and you have lots of shops and places to eat in the vecinity. For all the sushi lovers I recommend the Blue Ribbon restaurant on the hotel, excellent sushi, friendlly and non-pretentious.Resuming, if you are looking for a nice boutique hotel in midtown Manhattan, this is definately your place. The prices are attractive and the return is more than enough. We are definatelly looking forward to visiting this hotel again.The only negative thing I can think about is that the internet was not free...", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-17"}

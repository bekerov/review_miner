{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Inn / Awesome location", "text": "My wife and I stayed at the 414 Inn on our first ever trip to Manhattan in September. First and foremost, the location is outstanding! Located in Mid-town West on restaurant row, everything you need is within walking distance (and if you don't walk, they'll call you a cab or a car if you need to go to the airport - we used CarmelCar - $45 will get you to JFK). Many tourist sights are a few blocks away...Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Broadway, etc. The hotel itself is nice. The room was small yet very clean and quiet. It had the amenities of a regular hotel minus room service, but why would you want room service when every type of restaurant is a short walk? The staff was friendly, especially Michael. The continental breakfast was adequate. Don't expect B&amp;B cooking, but when we were on our way out sight-seeing, we certainly appreciated the cereal, juice, muffins, etc. that were provided. Overall, we have fond memories of the 414 Inn and would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Manhattan.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-10-04"}

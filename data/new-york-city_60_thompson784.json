The 60 T is fine you know what you are in for before you book so if you've got a ruck sack or are still in snow wash jeans ..Avoid this place. There are alot more hotels in town that I could name that are far more painful in the &quot; we think we are all that&quot; so we must be. Its fine fine fine here, just fine not wonderful just fine . I think the problem stems from peoples anticipation and expectations of a Jimmy Choo experience but want walmark prices. Get a room for under $200 and you will be pleased with this joint.. theres not much choice below Houston Street after all. If you pay $400 a night and then complain on this site well more fool you for paying the rate in the first place. Give the 60 T a break, I could vent my anger at some truly attrocious rip off joints.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-09-25"}

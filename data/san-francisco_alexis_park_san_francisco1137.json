{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Good for the price", "text": "After checking about 15 hotels, we decided to stay at the alexis park. The price was reasonable compared to most of the other hotels on lombard st. Parking is limited to first come first serve, but compared to other hotels is FREE. Most hotels we went to charged between $5-$30 a day for parking. Staff was helpful with public transportation to help us get around without a car. Rooms were clean. Read the other reviews on this site as we as others, and found nothing wrong with the rooms or the staff. Location is around alot of homeless, and other skeptical areas, but being around in sf for 3 days it seems like everywhere has homeless people. Its part of a big city in America.", "hotel": "alexis_park_san_francisco", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-28"}

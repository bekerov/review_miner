{"city": "chicago", "title": "The wrost hotel ever!", "text": "They have five elevator shafts, and it seems only two of them are working at any given time. You are waiting for at least 5 minutes for every elevator ride. And they are small - seven adults max. After 5 minutes of wait, you often have to pass and wait for the next one because it's full.If you are on the 22nd floor like I was, expect to spend at least 10 minutes to get to the ground floor. Taking the stairs actually was faster!They have a treadmill and a bike machine in the &quot;fitness center,&quot; which is about the size of your standard room (very small), and NEITHER OF THE MACHINE works. The bike machine didn't even turn on. What was worse was the treadmill! It started working, and the belt sticks and stops abruptly. I almost hurt myself from tripping over a treadmill!&quot;Free wireless,&quot; which is only available in the lobby area, didn't work. After spending 30 minutes on the phone with an outside-vendor tech guy from India, they couldn't figure out why it wasn't working.My room smelled like somebody had smoked, and the $9.95/day DSL didn't even work. When I had my room changed, the DSL I was finally able to connect was as slow as dial-up.The worst, absolutely worst, hotel, ever! Avoid this one, folks. A $55/night Motel 6 would be much, much better than this one.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-08"}

We stayed at the Amalfi, downtown, where we were very close to just about everything: Food, entertainment, museums and other sites of interest. The Amalfi' s service was excellent and the room was clean and comfortable. The complimentary Continental breakfast served daily was a great start to our day of adventures in touring a great town. We'll be back!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-25"}

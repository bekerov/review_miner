{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Americas WORST Value Inn ", "text": "This hotel is great if you don't mind other people's pubic hairs in your shower, the stench of mold and mildew throughout the room, the nightly noise of the downstairs bar 'till 4 AM, or the fact that the maid service only involves the making of the bed. Don't expect the room to be vacuumed or surfaces of any sort to be wiped down during your stay. Also, there are stains on the bedding and the furniture - which don't leave much room for the imagination. It is close to some decent restaurants and the Bart - but you might be better off joining one of the many homeless people in the street for the night.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_suites_soma", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-08"}

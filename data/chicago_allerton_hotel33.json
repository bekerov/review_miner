{"city": "chicago", "title": "Allerton Hotel New York in Chicago...", "text": "Chicago: The Allerton Hotel - Chicago. September 17 - 19, 2009 My husband and I were visiting family in Chicago and wanted to spend a couple of days downtown and booked our trip online. The Allerton came up as a four star and because of the location, I thought it would be a good deal. Our experience left a few things to be desired. The hotel is older but the renovations were nice. The valet and bellmen were very accomodating and could not have been more wonderful. We had a pleasant greeting at check-in and that's pretty much where the good times ended. We arrived in our room and the standard room was smaller than hotel rooms I stayed in while visiting New York and I didn't think that was possible. The bed must have been a full size bed and there was very little walk space on either side. The bathroom doesn't have any real counter space so all toiletries must be left on the desk. I turned the bed back and the linen was filled with soiled spots. When I called to inform the front desk, the woman was short, didn't apologize and let me know she would send housekeeping up. I called back 35 minutes later when no one showed up and spoke to the manager who was very apologetic and sent them up immediately. She assured me she would follow up with me to make sure things were satisfactory but never did. Welcome to The Allerton! The hotel was clean and the location couldn't have been better but if you are looking for comfort I say, keep looking.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-19"}

I had to call in other staff to verify that I had been there. The restaurant and bar are very very ordinary. The rooms are so small that once you have put your suitcase down there is NO floor space. I moved to the Radisson a couple of doors down as I had to stay one extra night and it was amazingly good value. Cost less. Huge room, huge bathroom and very pleasant.Avoid it. There are many better alternatives.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-28"}

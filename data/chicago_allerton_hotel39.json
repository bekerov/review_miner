{"city": "chicago", "title": "Location and breakfast buffet are great but that doesn't make up for the other issues", "text": "My stay was to take the IL bar exam, and about 10 colleagues of mine stayed as well. I specifically requested a room on the 4th floor when I made the reservation a month before. When I checked in, the lady tried to put me on the 16th floor, and argued with me when I told her I had the email they sent me stating the details of my reservation and my specific request. She eventually put me in a room on the 4th floor after I refused to take anything else. I have no clue what the rigamarole was for. I would have had to leave if I wasn't on a lower floor. The elevators are a total JOKE. After waiting over 10 minutes for one the first day, I took the stairs for the rest of my 3 day stay. I always saw a bunch of people waiting for the elevators. The stairs are cool, but for women staying in a city alone - probably not the safest. You can simply walk in off the street and up the stairs to the rest of the hotel floors. No locks to the doors leading to the stairs. Yes, your room door is locked, but would you want to take the chance of being on the hotel floor by yourself with an intruder?Cleanliness is not their forte. The seating area by the check-in desk is nice, but when I sat down, I noticed the buildup of dust on the mantle behind me. When I checked into my room, the TV remote on the desk was FILTHY. I had to clean it before I used it. On my final day there, I dropped something by my bed and when I bent to pick it up, I saw cigarette butts, hair and dust bunnies under the TV stand. Clearly, someone is just cleaning what can be seen and letting everything else get GRIMEY. And, the hotel is supposed to be completely non-smoking as well - so you would think they would clean up cigarettes.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-03"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Location Small Room!", "text": "This is the hotel to stay at for amazing location. Steps to Central Park, Radio City, Columbus Square, and very close to Times Square, this hotel was an ideal location for a visit to NYC. The room was small, very small - and we had upgraded to a queen. There was no closet, only an armoire, and therefore we had to call up to request an iron and ironing board. That being said, the bathroom was quite lovely and spacious. But really, in NYC, room size doesn't matter...because you should not be in your room except to sleep! Go out and DO something! The people working here were lovely, and the hotel was very very clean. The hallways were a bit dark, but serviceable. We took advantage of the free luggage storage before our trip back home. WiFi was $10 USD per 24 h.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-14"}

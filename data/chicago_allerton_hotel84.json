{"city": "chicago", "title": "Pretty perfect!", "text": "My husband and I (we're in our mid 20s) took a long weekend to see Chicago and &quot;get away&quot; from St Paul, MN. Our experience at the Allerton exceeded expectations at every turn. We arrived via train and took a very short taxi ride to the hotel from Union Station. We were greeted with lemonade in the lobby and warmly welcomed by every staff person we met. Check-in was fast and easy and we found our room to be very nicely decorated, spacious and perfectly clean. The concierge helped us get tickets to the river cruise that I read about on TripAdvisor and we enjoyed dinner at a nearby pizza place that had been recommended by a friend. The hotel's location is PERFECT for anyone wanting to do sightseeing in Chicago. You're ON the Magnicifent Mile and can easily walk to Navy Pier or Millennium Park in 15 minutes. Anyway, we had a great trip and really enjoyed staying at the Allerton. It's perfect for young adults looking for a nice place in a great location and at a reasonable price. One recommendation if you do stay here - don't waste your time/money with breakfast at the hotel restaurant.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-03"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "think again", "text": "this is a well situated hotel in which we had two different rooms for two recent stays within a few days of each other.The bathroom in one room was so difficult to enter,you almost had to be a contortionist.My real complaint was the fact that I received and paid two separate bills which were charged to my credit card ,but when I received my card account there was an item for several dollars charged the day we left.There were absolutely no extras to account for this,and onemailing the manager of the hotel as to the reason for this he or she failed to reply.Not the sort of treatment one expects at a so-called boutique hotel as they describe themselves", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-24"}

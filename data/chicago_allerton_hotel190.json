{"city": "chicago", "title": "very disappointing", "text": "We stayed here with a decent rate of 102/night via Hotwire. Unfortunatly the experience left a lot to be desired- even at that price. The woman who checked us in was very rude and gave us a full size bed accross from the elevator. When we requested a change the woman went from rude to horrible. The poor bellman was caught in the middle and even suggested we try to change the following night when a different person would be a the front desk. We indeed ended up switching the following day but again the front desk service was not consistent. One gentleman- rude- and the other accomadating. We also found their elevator system to be insufficient for the number of guests and found ourselves having to always wait for an elevator more than your typical wait. We enjoyed a simlar rate at the Ambassador East on a previous trip and would definitly recommend this over the Allerton.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-04-20"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Loved the Amalfi", "text": "Just returned from weekend at the Amalfi Hotel. Our group was celebrating an anniversary and birthday. The rooms were well appointed and clean, what you expect at a boutique hotel. Very comfortable beds and pillows. Spacious bathrooms with Aveda products. The continental breakfast was the freshest I have ever had at a hotel. Be sure to attend the manager's evening reception - top notch appetizers and cocktails. The bonus for me at this hotel was the friendly staff - NOT the typical snobs you find at some big city boutique hotels. Everyone we encountered from the bellman, front desk, housekeeping, and food attendants were gracious. The front desk even extended our checkout by 3 hours to accomodate our flight schedules. The location is convenient to Michigan Ave, the Loop, the El, and all River North has to offer. We will definitely stay here on our next visit to Chicago.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-08-02"}

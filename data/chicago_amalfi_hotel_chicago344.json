{"city": "chicago", "title": "Decent Hotel for a Decent Price", "text": "The Amalfi is a stylish, European hotel just off Michigan Avenue and within easy walking distance of most downtown attractions. It is tucked away a few blocks from the daily scrum that ensues on the Miracle Mile itself, which is a nice addition, and has some decent restaurants within a very short walk.Check-in was a breeze and the staff was very helpful with things like packages and directions. They were not very good at answering the phone both from inside and outside calls. However, they did reach out to me twice via my cell phone to let me know packages for my conference had arrived. There was bell service but I did not use it except for taxi fetching.The rooms were nice, clean and spacious for the price. The bed and bedding were slightly above the norm and comfortable. They had nice touches like updated flat-screen TVs, DVD players (with loaner movies available in the lobby) to suppliment the standard pay-per-view and CD clock radios. They also had CDs and used books in the room if you wanted/needed them. The Aveeda bath supplies were a very nice touch as were the quality towels. The bathroom was of a decent size, very clean and kept that way.I did not utilize the workout facility as walking around downtown took care of that chore, but it seemed nice. There was a restaurant affiliated with the hotel but I did not eat there. A bonus was the nearby bars and restaurants, including the ubiquitous Harry Carry's, Andy's Jazz Club and Rockit Bar. All are worth checking out while you are in town.Overall, it was a nice experience and I would recommend it as an alternative to the higher-priced chain hotels in that part of town.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-09"}

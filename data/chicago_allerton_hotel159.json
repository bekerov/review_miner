{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great hotel at a great price", "text": "The Allerton Hotel is in the heart of the Magnificant Mile on Michigan Avenue. Because of the low rate ($159) I feared it might be only average condition, but was pleasantly surprised that it was very up to date and clean. We even got a complementary upgrade to a junior suite which was very nice. (But note that it wasn't really a suite, just a large room). The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially the bellmen. The only drawbacks: we ate breakfast in the restaurant one morning and it was so-so and expensive; and the toilet in our bathroom was sited so we hardly had room for our knees.We would definitely stay there again.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-09-07"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Hotel - Good Price Value in Chicago", "text": "For inner city Chicago this Expedia special price was very good. The rooms are VERY small and cramped with the TV/Bar literally 10&quot; away from the bed. The wired internet service is tremendous though. The hotel is running low prices because it is in a major construction area. Each morning the workers right outside my window started at 6AM and WOW what a racket they make. The manager's nightly reception is easily the worst I have witnessed in Chicago. I asked for a refrigerator and microwave which was added to my room at no cost. The fridge is barely large enough to hold a small bottle of milk at one setting - FREEZE! Try pouring frozen milk on your breakfast cereal in the morning. The hotel is conveniently located though and I may stay here again depending upon the prices of other local hotels. In my opinion, Amalfi will need to keep their prices lower than $150 per night to maintain a steady client base.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-12"}

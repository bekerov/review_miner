{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Superior in every respect", "text": "Kimpton properties never disappoint, and this gem on Fisherman's Wharf is no exception. Clever and sleek nautical decor, gracious and attentive service, your selection of outstanding restaurants at every price range nearby (including an In-n-Out Burger!), and no fewer than three good quality bike rental shops within a 9-iron of the front door (6 mi to the Golden Gate, 11 to the peak of the Marin Headlands). One of my most enjoyable hotel stays for business in many years.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-08"}

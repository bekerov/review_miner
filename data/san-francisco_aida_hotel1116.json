{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Hated Aida Hotel", "text": "Aida Hotel is overpriced, considering its interior and location. My room was small and was VERY unpleasant to lodge overnight. The towels provided were uncleaned; mine had a hairball and a yellow stain on it. A lot of homeless people and &quot;gangsters&quot; were hanging outside the hotel at night as well. Aida Hotel also reminds me of one of those scary hostels you see on TV. In conclusion, this is a hotel I will never forget- it continues to haunt me whenever my family plans a vacation. (I don't even think Aida Hotel should even be considered a hotel!!!) FYI: My family and I only stayed at Aida Hotel for one night and stayed at Best Western for the remaining of our vacation (3 nights). Best Western was MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better and only costed a dollar less!", "hotel": "aida_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-18"}

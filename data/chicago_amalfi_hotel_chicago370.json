{"city": "chicago", "title": "Clean hotel", "text": "We stayed in Amalfi Hotel between 20-25.April. The room was nice and clean, the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was spacious. The hotel's location is very close to nice restaurants: my favorites are Shaw's Crabhouse for fresh seafood, Frontera Grill for Mexican and Weber Grill for a delicious BBQ...The only thing that I didn't like is the breakfast buffet, not too many choices and the buffet is not served in the breakfast room: you have to take your breakfast and go eat in another room..! However the afternoon snacks and complimentary drinks are wonderful: After a long day of shopping and visiting touristic places it is nice to have something ready when you go back to the hotel!!! :))", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-28"}

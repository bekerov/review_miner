{"city": "chicago", "title": "great service small room", "text": "Like other reviewers I found the rooms small. However, I was traveling by myself and the bathroom was roomy. The room was very clean and fairly new furnishings. Exercise room was more than I expected. The staff was exceptionally friendly and accomodating. It is just around the corner f/ Michigan Ave., close to Northwestern Hospital. All very convenient. Great place at a reasonable price. I'd stay here again.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-04-22"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Very friendly and stylish hotel in great location!", "text": "The best thing by far about 6 Columbus is the location. You are within walking distance to both the theater district and Lincoln Center, and you are close to many fine restaurants. The Columbus Circle subway stop is literally right across the street.The hotel itself is very modern, and although the lighting and decor were not quite to my taste, I must say that the staff was the friendliest I've encountered at a hotel in a long time. The room, while small, was spotless. Our only complaint would be that the heater seemed to just blow cold air around the room, so we ended up just turning it off and asking for another duvet. Actually, even with the heat off the room wasn't really all that cold.The heated bathroom floor was a really neat feature.We got a great rate through the hotel website, and we'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who's planning on attending a show or concert and doesn't need a whole lot of space.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-05"}

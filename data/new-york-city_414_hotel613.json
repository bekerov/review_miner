The little garden between the buildings let us feel tranquil in this 24/7 city. the rooms were large and the sweet breakfast in the morning was a great addition. Cheers for Mike whom made our trip even much nicer. This is our place in NYC we will come back again each time we get to NYC.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-10-16"}

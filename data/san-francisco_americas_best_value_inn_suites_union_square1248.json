{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "avoid at all costs!", "text": "The Photo of the Garland looked OK, and it was cheap, so we booked to stay for 5 nights from June 23rd.The 'foyer' was filthy, smelly and was full of flies. It was our first trip to the USA, it was 7.30 in the evening, we didn't know what to do. We thought that the room couldn't be that bad so we booked in.We were wrong. On our way to the room we noticed that many of the doors appeared to have been 'forced' and had had hasty repairs carried out.The door to our room was of a flimsy 'interior' type, not what you would expect in a hotel, e.g. fireproof. The room was cramped, dirty and smelly. My husband tried to open a window, this caused it to crack. The bath and sink were full of hair. There was one towel.We were terrified. There was no way we could stay there, we would have been frightened to leave our belongings in such a place. (I forgot to mention, there was also loud music blasting from a nearby room).We left our suitcases, took what we could carry, and found a decent hotel nearby.

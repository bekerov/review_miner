{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great location terrific breakfasts excellent value", "text": "We were unsure what to expect given that this is an older style, boutique hotel and we haven't travelled to San Francisco before and had read that the rooms were very small.. To our relief the hotel was very well situated, in easy walking distance to Union Square and in a very pleasant neighbourhood. The rooms were basic but comfortable and the fact that the hotel isn't new just added to the charm. In our group we had a twin bedroom and a double room. The twin bedroom was quite adequate for 2 and the bathroom had a large, deep bath which was great for a soak. The double room was a bit smaller and the bathroom did not have a bath. However this room was only occupied by one person and the size for one wasn't an issue.A continental style breakfast is available on each floor so you just have to pop out of your room and load up a plate with a choice of muffins, pastries, croissants and fruit. Juices, tea and coffee also available. A great idea and much better than having to go down to a restaurant.The restaurant (only available for dinner) was excellent. We didn't take advantage of the wine hour as we were always out at the time but maybe we will manage to fit that in on our next trip to San Francisco. Overall a very pleasant stay and great value. We will certainly choose to stay at the Andrews Hotel next time we visit.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-02-21"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Not bad budget hotel", "text": "We stayed 4 nights at this hotel after reading many reviews and in my opinion it is not a bad hotel. The good points are:*price and value is good if you're on a budget.*about 7/8 mins walk to Union Square/ 15 for Chinatown/near Powell Street*the bathroom and bed linen were very clean*breakfast is simple but atleast included, the blueberry muffins are nice*although not in the greatest area we felt safe* we asked to move rooms as near front of the hotel is noisey this was not a problem*front desk were v helpful, polite and knew info requiredNot so good points:*there is alot of homeless people but they leave you alone*i disliked the decor inside the hotel, v dated and needs modernising, if you like fishes and v colourful marine life you're in for a treat*there was a funny smell in the rooms, believe this maybe due to the carpets need renewing", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-04-29"}

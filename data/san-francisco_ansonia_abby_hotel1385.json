I have stayed at many B&amp;B hotels (which this place is). I believe that it is a good value because for $63 per night inlcuding tax (14% hotel tax in San Francisco) I receive: * a private room with bath (lots of hot water) * all-you-want-to eat breakfast (e.g. French toast, scrambled eggs, orange juice, tea/coffee/milk, bacon, ham) -- all average * all-you-want-to-eat supper (e.g., shells with ground beef, steamed broccoli and carrots, coffee/tea/milk, canned peaches) -- all average * free high-speed Internet access (5 computers with 24/7 access) * safe neighborhood only 3 blocks from Union Square My room has some carpet stains but the sheets and pillow cases are clean, the bathroom is small but clean, the room is reasonably quiet (get one in the back of the hotel and on an upper floor), and the staff folks are friendly and helpful. My room has a TV but only one channe comes in well; but I don't watch TV at home and one doesn't go to San Francisco to watch TV anyway.The Ansonia ain't the Hilton or even the Holiday Inn, but it's adequate for my needs and it fits my budget. I'd stay here again. I'd stay here aga", "hotel": "ansonia_abby_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-01-15"}

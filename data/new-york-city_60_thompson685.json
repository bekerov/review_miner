{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Friendly ", "text": "Thank you 60 Thompson!My GF and I recently stayed at 60 Thompson for a special weekend get away and let me say it was one of the best treats we've given ourselves this year! (and it's already august)The staffs are all very friendly and welcoming and actually listen and pay attention to the guests. We mentioned at arrival that it was a special weekend get away for us and when we got to our room later on, there was a note from the front desk staff with bottle of red wine and fruits (can you say mood setter!)Tiffany was the young lady at the desk who greeted us at arrival, so i believe she had all of her co workers initial the note to us, wishing us an enjoyable weekend. But let me note however, another young lady greeted us at departure and she knew of our weekend get away and extended an invite for next yea r. The concierge desk was very helpful as well (thns Bryan for all your help) and guy at the entrance too. Amazing staffs, great location- We will always be back!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-24"}

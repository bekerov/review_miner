{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "For the adventurous not for families", "text": "If you don't mind the smell of marijuana in your room at check in, the homeless and bath houses in the area plus the occasionally prostitute and drug dealer hawking their wares also in this neighborhood you won't mind staying here. I wouldn't walk alone at night personally (female) but otherwise it's certainly not the worst part of town. It is a bit dodgy though. Location is fairly close to main attractions. Good for the adventurous college student or other adventurous souls. I wouldn't recommend for families. Rooms are decent and fairly clean. A bit too much noise from the street. We ended up checking out after the hotel management couldn't manage to check us in properly (plus, we didn't like the smell of marijuana in our room nor the stunned looks on our teenagers' faces when we opened the hotel room).", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-05"}

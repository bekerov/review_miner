{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "I totally liked it!!", "text": "This is definitely the place to stay if you're aim is to explore Central Park and hit the museums! I got a really good deal for around US $225 per night and it's worth it. Clean, modern, great amenities and amazing sheets!! Central Park is right across road and all the bright lights of Broadway, Times Square and Madison Square Garden are all within walking distance. This truly is a gem located in mid-town for the reasonable price you pay.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-10"}

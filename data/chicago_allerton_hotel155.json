{"city": "chicago", "title": "We will definitely go back....", "text": "We booked the Allerton primarily for the location - which is awesome. So much to see and do within walking distance. Not planning on staying in the room much we reserved a petite room for $169, understanding that they are terribly small. Upon checkin, I took a chance and asked for a free upgrade. The friendly and accomodating clerk complied! We were given a junior suite on the 20th floor that was wrapped back around a corner far from the elevator. It was extremely quiet and peaceful. The only unusual thing about the suite was the door opened to the sleeping area and not the sitting room. There was a spanking clean bathroom inbetween rooms with a nice sized shower and plenty of room for toiletries on the shelf over the pedestal sink. The usual amenities were available - coffee maker (1 cup), hair dryer, iron. Two thick, plush bathrobes were provided. The room spanned one of the north jutouts thus giving us a view from three sides. There were plenty of windows to let in lots of light. Lined curtains kept the rooms dark in the morning.The third floor is beautiful, with high ceilings and dark, detailed wood trim. Just the character I expect from an older hotel.We tried the breakfast buffet before departure - using the 20% discount coupon. I thought the selection was great and the food delicious. I would recommend giving it a try.If you use valet parking, be prepared for a $45/day charge on your bill. Next time we may drop our luggage off at the hotel and park in Grant Park.Elevators are small, which I think is quaint. We didn't wait more than a couple minutes for one. I'd steer clear of the service elevator. It's pretty scary!We won't hesitate to stay at the Allerton again.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-03"}

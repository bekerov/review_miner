{"city": "chicago", "title": "Nice Location but EVERYTHING else SUCKS!!!", "text": "The good news:The Location is the ONLY saving grace for this hotel. It is located in the magnifiient mile area, which is awesome.Now for the BAD news:Just about EVERYTHING else in this hotel SUCKS. The rooms are BOXY as hell. It is THE smallest room I have ever lived in. The bathrooms &amp; elevators have TINY as heck entrances. Room service/maintenance is EXTREMELY slow to actually respond. We were not even given all the amenities that were mentioned in the brochure. There was supposed to be a safe but there was none in the actual room that was given to us. When we complained, they refused to even look into it and, ofcourse we didnt have time to keep following up with them, I mean we were there to see and enjoy the city, not keep following up and fighting with the management. Heck even Internet access is not free. They dont put new soaps and shampoos unless you have to ask both the front desk AND the room service staff themselves to actually do so.An yeah. FORGET about getting any kind of view even though you are in the best location. The room we had, HAD NO VIEW (unless you consider viewing some dumpsters down below as a view).Oh before I forget. The water in the shower ran out WHILE I WAS IN THE SHOWER. NEVER seen THAT happen before even in 2 and 3 star hotels.Bottom line: Very nice location, but I would NOT recommend this place.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-05"}

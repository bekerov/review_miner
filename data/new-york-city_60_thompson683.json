{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great stay in Soho!", "text": "I stayed at The Mercer last year in Soho and wanted to try somewhere else and 60 Thompson didn't disappoint! Substanially cheaper than The Mercer, 60 Thompson is just as convenient and the rooftop bar is a MAJOR plus!! Loved it! The FRESH amenities were so fab that I had to go the Fresh Store and purchase more shampoo to take home to Sydney with me!! And the bedsheets were to die for! I look forward to checking out the other sister hotels as I've stayed in 2 of them now and I have no hesitation in going back there again :)", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-18"}

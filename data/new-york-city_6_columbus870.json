{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "The Find of the Year", "text": "My wife and I spent four wonderful nights at this very trendy and elegant hotel for our honeymoon during the Thanksgiving weekend of last year. I had meant to write a review earlier, but I never found the time. Shame on me. This hotel was aesthetically beautiful, since it had only been open for around a month when we stayed there. The lobby is cozy and attractive. The rooms are both homey and artsy in design, although on the small side, which is common for Manhattan. You really have to get used to the bed corners, because you will end up banging your shins a couple of times against them. But no matter. The bathroom was comfortable and clean. The TV set was an LCD screen, which I liked a lot. The hotel is perfectly located around the corner from Columbus Circle, which makes it extremely easy to move within the city by subway, bus or just by walking. The staff was really friendly and attentive. All in all, we had a wonderful honeymoon and this hotel was a great part of it. I tried to book us again to celebrate our anniversary this year, but the rates have already gone up from what we originally paid (I paid $189/night... I guess I was lucky that the hotel had just recently opened). For those who can afford it, I highly recommend it.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-25"}

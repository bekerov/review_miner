{"city": "chicago", "title": "Ignore the Whiners", "text": "My husband booked us here for the weekend but when I got on line and read some of the reviews I was a little apprehensive. No need; ignore the whiners. The room was not large but not tiny either. Nice decor. Clean. Great location. Nice linens and bath products. Great view. Staff was very helpful. And the price for this place is the best part. What's not to love? With a Corner Bakery and Starbucks steps away and ice bucket in the room, there's no need for a coffeemaker or fridge. If these are important items for you stay at a chain like the Hyatt or Hilton and leave more interesting places to people like me.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-28"}

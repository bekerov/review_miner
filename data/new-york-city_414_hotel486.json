We booked last minute and got a great rate.... our room was so cozy we didn't want to leave. The staff, especially Sakena, were delightful, quick to help and got us a car booked when we left. Like a great home. See you again 414. Best of Luck!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-27"}

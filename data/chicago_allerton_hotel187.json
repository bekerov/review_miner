{"city": "chicago", "title": "Some things to watch for...", "text": "First and foremost, if you want to stay right in the heart of downtown, this is your place! Also, its one of those great, grand old red-brick buildings which I find beautiful - yet the inside was clean and modern looking so it made for a very enjoyable experience. I don't like when people complain of the room size because I thought it was a pretty good-sized room compared to some hotels in big cities like New York, Boston, etc - now THOSE are small rooms! And the cleanliness and cuteness of the rooms make up for it - the bed was very comfortable and the cleaning staff should be commended also for their customer service. There were a few times that a cleaning woman held an elevator for us. However, they are the only staff that seems to care at all for customer service as the rest of the staff leaves something to be desired for. Everytime I called the hotel for help, I was directed to a voicemail system. I believe that a concierge should always be available - especially considering I was checking which subway stop to get off of and I was on the subway at the time so I really needed help quickly! Plus I had to call on a question when I got home and the accounting dept and operators were all pretty rude to me. Otherwise, I think this is a great hotel to stay at - they might do better if they have a staff overhaul &amp; get some powerful customer service reps in there. As for the elevators, yes, they're a bit small, and a little slow but really nothing THAT horrible - you just get the next elevator if its got a few people in it already and I don't recall waiting for much longer than 5 minutes at the most for any of the elevators. And I think its charming to go up 3 floors, then need a 2nd elevator - its different!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-04-30"}

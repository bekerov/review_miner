{"city": "chicago", "title": "so-so", "text": "The Allerton Crowne Plaza is in a great location, on the Magnificent Mile with lots of stores and restaurants. The hotel itself, however, is over-priced for what you get (I paid $249/night for a small room with 1 king-sized bed). I stayed there for 2 nights on business and had a non-smoking room that smelled of smoke. The window shade broke the first day (although it was fixed promptly) and the room was directly across from a service elevator that emitted a ringing noise every time it was used (day and night). The room was small and had a shower but no bathtub and only 1 bar of soap to share for the shower and sink.There was free coffee for the coffeemaker, but no tea. I would hope for more that price.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-10-05"}

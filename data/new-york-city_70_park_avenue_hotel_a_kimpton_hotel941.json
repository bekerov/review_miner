{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Needs an update...badly.", "text": "I just returned from a 2-night stay with my boyfriend and was somewhat disappointed by the hotel. The lobby was nice...free wine in the evenings is a great touch and the staff were hospitable, but the actual rooms desperately need a re-vamp. Our room seemed dingy and dark and if you're even close to six feet tall, good luck trying to use the toilet....we both had to sit with our legs off to the side! While the shower pressure was great, we literally had to perform acrobatics over the toilet to get into the shower. Also, the walls seem paper thin and the windows need double glazing - we heard every taxi horn from the street below. I've stayed in many other NYC hotels on the same level and most have soundproof windows at least. My only other complaint is that there were trolleys full of towels and used laundry left in the hallway near our room....a small detail, surely, but it didn't help the overall asthetics.All in all, I don't think I'd stay here again as there are other hotels in the same price range that offer more for your money.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-22"}

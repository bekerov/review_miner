{"city": "chicago", "title": "very pleasant and accommodating staff", "text": "We were staying with a Collette tour group (great tour with Barbara and Fred) so we did not have to check in or check out. We did find the room small. but the beds were very comfortable.In the bathroom, there is only one very small shelf and no counter space. For two women traveling together, this was an inconvenience. The location was great. We LOVED Millennium Park. A must see is &quot;the bean&quot; and Crown Fountain, which changes colors and pictures--very beautiful. A local tour guide mentioned that the park has the best sound system in the world for their concerts and they were right. We stayed for a Gershwin concert and we were amazed. Also, the Wendella boat trip which included the river and lake was great. We found Chicago very beautiful with hardly any litter. The people of Chicago were also very helpful to tourists. We asked a gentlemen for directions and noticed a few minutes later that he borrowed a bicycle to catch up with us to redefine his directions--amazing. The folks at the hotel were also very helpful. Thanks to Jon (doorman) for recommendating Park Grille at the Park and for Tyrone and the front desk staff for good service, and the folks in the dining room which ran a first-class operation. We only had the buffet breakfast, but it was superb and managed very well. We also ate at Gino's East, which we enjoyed for Chicago Pizza. Be ready to wait for about an hour for their deep dish pizza. Ask the concierge for a coupon for free bread sticks there, which were very good and filled the void until the pizza came. The elevators were never a concern for us, but be careful not to get on the service elevator. We had a good experience at this hotel and truly loved Chicago.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-29"}

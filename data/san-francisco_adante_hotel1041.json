{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great value", "text": "We were also a little worried about some of the bad reviews, but on this trip to the city we were extremely budget conscious and only needed a one night stay anyway. It is an old hotel, however, our bathroom was brand new, squeaky clean with jacuzzi tub, and the room itself was squeaky clean. Frankly, the bathroom newness/cleanliness and room cleanliness is what really matters to me anyway. So we were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the brief stay. Regarding noise; the walls were a bit thin, and I think only at one point did i hear any talking, but if you had loud neighbors i guess that could be a problem, although loud neighbors and be a problem with thicker walls too. we did hear some street noise (motorcycles and sirens). The only potential problem I saw was if you had a room near the ice machine. The ice machines were located close to rooms and i actually felt bad using it at night, because if the rooms adjacent to it were occupied, it would be obnoxiously loud. So when you reserve, make sure you are on a floor that doesn't have one or a room that is far away from it. For the price, it was great!!", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-11-05"}

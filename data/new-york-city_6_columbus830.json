{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Small rooms doesn't begin to describe it", "text": "An otherwise acceptable stay (5 nights) degraded by a room (allegedly the largest and clearly the highest price offered short of a suite) in which we couldn't sit down, except on the bed, even to work at the desk. One chair was offered, in a dimly lit vestibule. Otherwise there was literally no room to move. Closet space was a free-standing wardrobe with barely a foot of hanging space. Storage space was a drawer under the bed. Plumbing noises from adjacent rooms were noticeable and from time to time (especially during neighbors' showers) loud. I accept that space is at a premium in New York, but this is absurd. On the plus side, such as it was, it's convenient to Lincoln Center, pleasant and helpful staff and a good restaurant (Blue Ribbon) with excellent sushi. If you plan to spend any time in your room, look elsewhere.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-03-17"}

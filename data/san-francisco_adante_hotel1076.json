{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "It's an OK hotel", "text": "We stayed for 6 nights; we just had one problem, which was the toilet flooding on our first night. The hotel staff were really good took care of it straight away when we reported it. The rooms were reasonably clean (mould on the carpet near the radiator); there was no air con only a fan on the ceiling could do with some modernisation. Hotel staff were really friendly, I think the place is ok considering what you pay. The Adante was in a good location, within walking distance to Union Square, only downside is there are quite a few homeless people nearby who beg for money but they don't pose any real threat. There is bus stop right outside the hotel that heads down to Union Square. If I return to San Francisco I would stay here again.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-06-24"}

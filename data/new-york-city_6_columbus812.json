{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Trendy but nice...", "text": "I was persuaded to stay here by my boss instead of the Parker Meridien as she counts it as one of her favorite hotels in NYC. I came for meetings and stayed for the weekend with my partner. I thought this was a charming hotel with well-chosen decor and amenities - from the mid-century furniture in the lobby to the fur-covered walls of the elevators. My room was cozy with teak walls, great magazines, a small free-standing wardrobe and blue-tiled bathroom complete with Kiehls bath products. The location is right across the TimeWarner Center (and Columbus Circle subway stop). Time Square is a few blocks away, as well as some great restaurants. I would definitely stay here again.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-16"}

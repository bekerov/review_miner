{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great friendly little hotel", "text": "Stayed two nights in September 05 and loved it. Room very clean and well presented, staff couldn't have been more helpful - taking bags upstairs (we'd arrived afer a two week cruise with a lot of stuff!) - storing bags for free before check-in and after checkout. Excellent self-serve breakfast facilities. Free Internet terminal. As Brits who'd never been to NY before we felt very comfortable walking the neighbourhood day and night. Over the intersection across 9th are dozens of good restaurants, and Times Square is only a couple of long blocks away. Would not hesitate to recommend.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-09-27"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "horrible avoid at all costs", "text": "The room, especially the bathroom was filthy. The service was terrible, we had no light in the bathroom and was told we had to wait until the next day for someone to look at it. The toilet backed up. There were bums picking through garbage in the parking lot. I had cigerette burn holes in my sheet. It was VERY loud due to traffic. They missed giving us our wakeup call by one hour. I could go on and on. Best to avoid this hotel at all costs, the savings aren't worth it.", "hotel": "america_s_best_inn_san_francisco", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-11-06"}

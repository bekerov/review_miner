Easy walking distance to Times Square &amp; adjoining areas. Great restaurants all around this place. We LOVED the comfortable queen bed...Our Room was just across the courtyard from the lobby and was very quiet. Our transportation back to the airport was even arranged by the front desk staff without any problems on short notice. Would stay here again!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-30"}

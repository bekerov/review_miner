Can't beat the location, the lobby is beautiful, the staff is very friendly (make sure to sign up for the Kimpton InTouch program if you are not already a member- you get free snacks and stuff.) The wine reception is very cool, the tv and other tech gadgetry is up to date and top notch, and the beauty products provided in the bathrooms are high quality. I love this place. It represents an EXCELLENT value. We are going back aug 1 for another broadway weekend excursion and I hope the trip will be just as lovely.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-13"}

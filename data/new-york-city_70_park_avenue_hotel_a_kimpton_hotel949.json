{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "My new favorite hotel", "text": "I was a little worried after reading the few poor reviews re: the hotel. But I am so happy to report that 70 Park Ave. was awesome. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The rooms (although not huge - but what do you expect - it's NYC) were very clean and comfortable. The lighting was a little low, but it was fine. Our view was of a brick building, but I didn't mind because we didn't have street noise to worry about. The beds were very comfortable too. I LOVED the location. It was in a mostly residential neighborhood, but only 2 blocks from Grand Central Station which made getting anywhere a breeze. This has become my hotel of choice when I am in NYC - I am planning another trip in the fall and will definately stay at 70 Park Ave.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-06"}

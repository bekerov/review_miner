{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "It was fine", "text": "Just returned from a great stay in New York city during which we stayed for the most part with family. However one night we stayed down town to meet friends and stayed the night in the 414.We found this hotel to be a good base, it is within a close walking distance of Times Square and Broadway. The bedroom was clean, however I felt that the bathroom floor could have been cleaner. The water in the bath was also not as hot as I would have liked, infact it was lukewarm. Saying this the price of the stay was exceptionally reasonable. I had investigated the possility of other accommodations and I was surprized this hotel was so competitive in price. The beds are very comfortable, there is a flat screen tv and internet access on the ground floor. I found the staff most helpful. The girl at the desk gave us directions to two different restaurants-one expensive, one less expensive. We took the less expensive option and the food proved to be excellent here. She also provided us with directions to various locations in the City.My husband and I would consider staying in this accommodation aagin.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-13"}

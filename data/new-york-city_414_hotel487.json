{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "A tad pretentious? But shoot me.", "text": "The hotel is situated very well for the Upper West side attractions and isn't too far from Central Park. There are lots of bars and restaurants close by, especially in the imaginatively named, &quot;Restaurant Row&quot; (they must have been up all night thinking that one up). Anyhow, I stayed for two nights in the ground floor &quot;King's Suite&quot; (or King's Room...whatever) which was well, good, but not terrific. It was very tired - the kind of place where you knew that if you moved something there may well be something unpleasant behind it. You know the feeling you get in some hotel rooms...? It looked like it needed a good fix-up and was long overdue for it.The one member of staff that I saw there was on reception as I left and was extremely pleasant and helpful. She even spoke English so I knew I wasn't in London. There is no lift (elevator) in the hotel, so if (like a couple of grand old dames I encountered as they checked in) you are roomed on the second floor (that's 3rd in American) you are going to have to not only walk up but carry your bags up yourself too, unless I'm there to help you as I happened to be at the time. No-one else seemed keen on the job - certainly no staff made an offer.Breakfast is a basic affair which you have to pour/serve/find yourself. There is only one table to eat at unless you want al-fresco. No, that is not the name of the chef.My bill for two nights was over USD500 which without extras of any kind I thought was maybe a little steep?

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Hotel!", "text": "We enjoyed our stay at Adante Hotel &amp; would stay there again. We were greeted Tony at checkin who was always friendly &amp; helpful at the front desk. Our room was clean &amp; tidy with a huge ensuite, big TV, iron, safe &amp; ceiling fan. The area can feel a bit dodgy at night, but we felt safe going to &amp; from the hotel. The only negative is that the complimentary breakfast isn't very exciting, so we went to 'Dottie's True Blue Cafe' nearby &amp; enjoyed delicious breakfasts there.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-12"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great location small room", "text": "Stayed here for 5 nights last week. Top location 5 mins walk from cable cars and Union Square. Loads of MUNI buses in area as well. Wine hour between 5.30 - 6.30 was most appreciated after a hard day sightseeing - my pal even got a free glass when she joined me one day - it is one glass each. Only problems were size of rooms which are a bit pokey - I couldnt lay my suitcase out properly. Also restaurant / bar closed early - I couldnt have a nightcap at 9.30pm. Staff v friendly esp Oscar the main receptionist. My tip - fab traditional diner round corner on corner adjacent to Geary Theatre. Open until late. Also v good Scottish bar called Edinburgh Castle on Geary (?) round corner serves pitchers of 3 plus pints for $9. Also you can smoke on the roof very nice views of Downtown.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-04-04"}

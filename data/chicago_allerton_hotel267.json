{"city": "chicago", "title": "We Had A Good Time !!", "text": "Just returned from a workshop at the Allerton Crowne Plaza. My husband and I stayed there along with two kids. We were given a handicap accessible room which included a sleeper sofa with a second tv in a separate area. I would consider it a mini-suite layout. This was a big plus w/ 2 kids.Since I was there for a workshop, I was able to sample their food and it was excellent. Also, I highly recommend the room service pizza.Overall, a great place to stay. Elevator service can be a bit slow and I did hear some fellow workshop attendees complaining about small rooms; but we had a good time and would not hesitate to return.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-06-14"}

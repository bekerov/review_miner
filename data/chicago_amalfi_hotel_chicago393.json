{"city": "chicago", "title": "best hotel I stayed at in a long time", "text": "if I go back to Chicago, I will stay there again. Usually, i prefer to try new places, but i liked this one so much that I will go back in a heartbeat.I do not understand the comments (a few below) about the red color in the lobby, i remember it being blue and green and orange... and the sofas were not stained... It's the first time i feel a hotel web site matches with the real thing.Reception:The employees have the coolest uniforms (leather vest, bright shirt...) and they were always very helpful.Room:Nice size, very comfy and with the regular tea and coffee you also have the option of hot cocoa... nice touch in January!I liked that the mugs where not the plain black ones (are those ever really clean or not?) but transparent turquoise glass ones.they are changing the tiny tiles in the bathroom for large slates...nice touch.I liked the yellow towels, it's different. The selection of Aveda products was great...and the shower heads...wonderful.Location: very very good. There is a bar names Rockit behind that I loved and a French brasserie around the corner that I didn't have time to try. Close to the hotel is harey carey (yum, the chips...) and Redfish (sooooo slooooowwww service and mediocre food!)I should also mention that I was organizing a meeting and the sales and catering staff were amazing and I heard only great comments from my group.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-01-29"}

Suggest asking for a room in the rear of the hotel as the street noise can be unbearable in the night. Nice pastries in the morning, on each floor right outside your room...convenient. Great Italian restaurant...Fino... on site. Can't beat it for the money!", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-17"}

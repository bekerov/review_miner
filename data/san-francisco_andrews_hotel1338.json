{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great place to stay", "text": "We stayed at the Andrews Hotel for 7 nights and thought it was great. It's a small Hotel and we had a small double room with shower but it was everything we needed. We were out all day anyway, we were only sleeping there after all. The shower was great, had quite a bit of space considering the size of the whole room. Our room was located right next to the lift though so at certain times in the morning, it got quite busy with people in and out of the lift but it wasn't a big hassle. Loved having brekkie in my PJ's in bed - fruit, bread rolls and muffins galore. Coffee was great and my boyfriend loved the fresh orange juice. Fino's was lovely, we always managed to get the same waiter and he was really good. In our 7 day stay we managed to eat there 3 times and he remembered what drinks we had had previosuly etc. Brilliant! The staff in the Hotel are all great, they arranged our Napa and Carmel Tours for us which are highly recommended if you have time during your stay. Hotel is in a great location, Union Square shopping just down the road to the left. If you turn right out of the Hotel though and walk for about 5/10 minutes it can be quite down and out and scruffy looking. We never felt threatened by anybody during our walks though, we always felt safe. Great Hotel, great location for Union Square, great staff and reasonably priced. We would stay there again.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-12-15"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "will not visit again", "text": "I recently booked two rooms at the Allerton for our parties, and was quoted one price and the conformation stated another. Upon bring this to the attention of the staff, no change was made. Our two rooms were specified to be connecting, but upon check in we were 5 floors apart and nothing could be done due to being sold out. The elevators and rooms were like match box cars. Although the bathroom was decent size, if you have more than one adult, fitting toilettries on the counter was quite impossible. We had other individuals meeting us at the hotel, but the sign is difficult to spot, especially to those that are unfamiliar with the area and urban traffic. Though these bumps in the road may seem minimal to some, when you put in your time, effort, and hard earned dollar to stay somewhere, you want a good experience in return.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-08-09"}

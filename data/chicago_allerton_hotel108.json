{"city": "chicago", "title": "If only we'd asked to see the room first!", "text": "We had planned a 3 night stay: requested a king size bed, on as high a floor as possible &amp; near my sister &amp; brother in law who were traveling with us. When we arrived, the bellman was very helpful, directed us to the elevator that would take us to the reservation desk. Once there we were told our room wasn't ready but my sisters was. When we checked back a few hours later it still wasn't ready, then it was, but not on the same floor as my sister, not even close! Avoid room 1011 at all cost, a queen bed you can hardly walk around. At night I couln't get past my husbands feet without hitting the radiator at the foot of the bed. Who ever laid out this room in the redesign should have measured the room better. When requesting things like a remote control for the TV, a clock for the room or extra towels, it appeared to be an inconvience for some of the staff, why should I have had to request these things? Will try not to stay there again, at least not in room 1011. Would be nice for 1 person. The bathroom was large but had a moldy smell.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-29"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Will never go back", "text": "My husband and I stayed for two nights in this hotel and we were very dissapointed. We had booked the room a month in advance and requested a non smoking room, and what did we get, a smoking room.....just great. The room was stinking, my husband called the reception to change the room and of course they were full.....the standard answer. He then asked to speak to the manager on duty who implied that we had made the mistake and did not request non smoking and that she could not help us in any way. The room was $450 a night, this must pay for the trendy uniforms the staff were wearing....surely not for the managers salary. After a heated converstion miracously they found another room....what's the chances eh. Why could they not have just done that in the first place. We had dinner there as it was now 10.30pm and after dinner we went to the bar. We were met at the bar door by another ex model who asked if we had requested a seat in the bar? We had no idea such a thing was needed, we informed her that we were residents but hey, ho......not good enough. There was a large table empty and when we pointed this out we were informed that it was kept vacant incase a &quot;VIP&quot; should arrive, not for the likes of us.I love good looking hotels and good looking people but this hotel was just too shallow for me. Will never return to 60 Thompson.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-09-05"}

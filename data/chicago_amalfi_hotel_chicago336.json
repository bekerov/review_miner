{"city": "chicago", "title": "Small Clean Great Staff", "text": "The Amalfi is a small hotel, only about 6 floors, that shares it's building with office space next door. The room was clean, with a nice television, free wireless, and a fantastic shower. The staff genuinely seemed interested in making your stay as comfortable and easy as possible. I also liked the continental breakfast by the elevators of each floor.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-09"}

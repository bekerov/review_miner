{"city": "chicago", "title": "My new favorite Chicago Hotel", "text": "I'm writing this review from the hotel. I'm here for a conference that is taking place at the Allerton and a block of rooms were set aside. I stayed here 9 years ago or so and it was very old and needed to be updated. When I saw that the conference would be here my first thought was &quot;are they kidding?&quot; but I checked out the Allerton website and saw that the entire place had been completely redesigned. I still wasn't 100% sure but they had pictures of the outside as well so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm really glad I did. The hotel has a boutique hotel feel without the snotty attitude that one finds at other hotels in the genre. It is very clean, all new lobby, bar, restaurant and rooms. The rooms are still small (as they were before) - which is fine with me - but the beds are comfortable and the bath roomy. All of the staff - and I really mean ALL - is very friendly and helpful. They have gone out of their way to make sure I am comfortable, have heated milk for my coffee and helped with reservations. The food is great too!Highly recommend it!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-06"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "great location", "text": "I got a great deal on Priceline for $130.00 a night. It was very clean and nicely designed. Rooms are small, but who spends time in their room in NYC? Heated bathroom floors were a great plus, as were the Kiehl's products. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The best thing that this hotel is its location. It is located literally right next to a subway stop - 1, A, B, C, D. The hotel restaurant, Blue Ribbon, has very good sushi.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-11"}

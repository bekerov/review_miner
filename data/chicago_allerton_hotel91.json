{"city": "chicago", "title": "Dirty Rip Off", "text": "We stay in Chicago twice a year for business and have tried many hotels. Here is my laundry list of problems with The Allerton:1) Used tissue on the floor next to the bed when I arrived and never picked up by housecleaning during my stay. 2) Splatter from waste basket on bottom of desk never cleaned from previous guest.3) Bathroom shade fell off when trying to pull it down and cut arm.4) My fault: I left my phone charger in the wall in front of the bed. I know it was there, but of course, house keeping never reported anything in lost and found, so when I called, they can do nothing.5) They messed up the checking-in process so that my co-worker's credit card was on my room and she wasn't checked in to a room at all, even though she had a room card. We had to go back to the lobby twice to get it straightened out.OVERALL: They've dressed this place up pretty nice but they can't hide the fact that their staff is lazy and even a little shady, even if the concierge has a foreign accent. An open fire in the lounge and some trendy bedroom fabric doesn't make up for a poorly ran hotel or justify the extremely high prices. In the past we've paid the same amount for a much larger room at Hotel 71.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-29"}

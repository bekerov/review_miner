{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great location so-so hotel.", "text": "We stayed for a weekend in June and the location was great, but the hotel is clearly taking advantage of its location to offer less. The rates are similar to other loop locations. The carpet in our room was filthy, and no, dim lighting will not mask it! The room was slightly larger than the queen size bed. There was room for a small desk, but not much more. And the temperature outside was about 85 and it was rainy, and it felt about like that in our room. I think the thermostat is for a placebo effect. You really do need some cool, dry air to combat the humidity, and it was not there. So all in all, I'd stay somewhere else. We paid $51 for parking each night, you could stay somewhere else and take cabs for that money.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-21"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Place To Stay", "text": "We just returned from a 2 night weekend stay at Crowne Plaza Allerton and had no problems at all. I also had some concerns about our stay after reading all the reviews and now understand that those people must expect a whole lot. I guess if I really looked hard enough, I might could see some issues and something to complain about. I even booked it through hotwire and got a great deal. I still received a king size bed with a great view of Michigan Ave. I can't believe that people complain about going to the 3rd floor to register. Yes, the elevators are small, but so what?? The rooms might have been a little smaller that other hotels, but we were just in and out to sleep and change clothes. The bathroom was well lit and had a great makeup mirror attached to the wall. The front desk was staffed just fine. We had no problems for check in or out. If you have a room booked at this hotel, you will enjoy it unless you are the type of person that complains about everything.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-11-01"}

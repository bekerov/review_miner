{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Andrews Hotel Post Street San Francisco", "text": "I've just returned home from San Francisco and stayed at the Andrews. We had room 705 on the top floor. The room was perfect for a couple, with a comfortable double bed, a tv and video (you can get videos to watch for free from the lobby), a sink, and a nice large fan on the ceiling. At the end there is a small room containing a toilet and a shower. The place was very clean. There were a couple of windows that were single glazed. The only bad point was that the windows didn't cut out a lot of outside noise and the main thing that we could hear were the fans blowing on the roof. Also you can hear a fire engine going at least once an hour, and those things make so much noise! They sound like something you'd hear during the war. The lift has a lot of character. There's also tea and coffee making facilities in the lobby 24 hours a day. Breakfast is laid out every morning in the corridor, but you need to be quick to get the good stuff! The staff at reception are so nice. Oscar is quite a character, and John the guy with the ponytail is absolutely drop dead gorgeous! The hotel is in a good location. I would recommend it. I've included a photo which is the view we had from our hotel window.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-05-16"}

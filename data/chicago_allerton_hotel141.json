{"city": "chicago", "title": "What a great bargain", "text": "I was a bit scared to book this hotel based upon some comments, but I must say, I experienced no negative aspects. I think the renovations are all done, except for the elevators (which are kind of slow). My room is excellent, and I am a hotel snob. I am a woman traveling alone, so booked a double bed room, and asked for a renovated room in the comments section on the hotel website, based upon other TripAdvisor reviews. When I checked in they gave me a room with a king bed on the 11th floor. The room is newly renovated and very clean and spacious. Bed has nice linens. Bathroom amenities are from L'Occitane...very nice. Magnefying mirror for makeup, always a plus. Clean. Not a ton of closet space or drawer space. Wi-Fi is free on the 2nd floor lobby, but $9.95 if you want it in your room. The locaion is PERFECT. 1.5 blocks from Rush Street where all the bars/restaurants are. 1 block from Saks/Neiman. I got this room for $89 (AAA rate) on their website. This is a steal. I would expect to pay double for this room in this location. The bellhop said that this hotel used to be old and stodgy. But the furnishings now are very modern and up to date. I recommend ths hotel.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-03-14"}

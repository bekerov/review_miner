{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Wonderful location", "text": "Stayed in the Andrews Hotel from 29th September to 4th October. Really enjoyed our stay - Was very quaint and had a lot of character. The location was ideal - just a few blocks from Union Square and transport links. The room was small but we were aware of that when we booked it. The bathroom was tiny and in fact was not much bigger than the closet. This was our only fault with the room and overall we were pleased with the hotel. Our room and the hotel overall were very clean. Did not find it noisy but we were on the 7th floor. Would definitely recommend the restaurant in the hotel - Fino's - excellent. Anna at the front desk was very helpful with booking trips.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-22"}

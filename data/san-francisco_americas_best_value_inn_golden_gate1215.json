I traveled alone to Frisco to see some friends... The tall (6'3&quot;), skinny, middle-eastern guy at the front desk was the WORST. (I describe him, b/c I don't remember his name and I want you to avoid him and this hotel!) When I checked in alone, he was kind to me. When I told him I was staying in the room alone for the weekend, he looked at me with the most evil RAPIST eyes I've ever seen. He asked me how much I paid for my tickets on Travelocity, when I told him he got mad... I guess I paid too little for his liking. This guy is the only one that works at the hotel day and night... he was watching me come and go and asking odd questions. The worst part was when he saw me with my male friend in the morning... I took my friend back to my room mid-day after lunch to relax. He accused me of lying about being in my room alone, and while we were out he de-activated my room card, so I couldn't get back in... He also searched my room and found some tobacco in one of my bags and laid it out on the table... When we came back and my card would not let me in the room I had to go to him... he said he would re-activate the card and that HE MUST let me in himself... when he did, he barged in the room, pointed to the tobacco and accused me of smoking in a non-smoking room. Then, he started yelling at me, and he charged my credit card $250 for smoking... which apparently was in the fine print of the contract. I left a day early and will never return. PLEASE, DO NOT TRAVEL ALONE HERE IF YOU ARE A WOMAN.PLEASE, DO NOT USE THIS HOTEL.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-13"}

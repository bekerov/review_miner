{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Restaurant Row Location", "text": "I love the proximity to restaurant row dinning! The 414's continental breakfast is just enough to start the day right. Take some time to sip your coffee/tea on the patio. The bedding is comfy and the room doesn't feel cramped like many NY hotel rooms. The wi-fi caused trouble at first, but once they reset it, it worked fine. Plus, there is a computer in the lobby for guest use.A stay at the 414 Hotel in NYC feels more like staying at a friend's house, than the hassle it can be to stay at some larger hotels. I even got a thank you note from the housekeeper when I left a tip. Highly recommended!!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-09-11"}

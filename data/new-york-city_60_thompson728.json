{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Freezing rooms", "text": "This property has a serious heating problem. The room was so cold despite repeated compliants I eventually contracted a cold. Decor was bland, staff were unhelpful and the business centre consists of a laptop sitting on the front desk. We had a much better and much hipper experience at Gramercy Park Hotel which scores poorer on Tripadvisor. Will not be visiting 60 Thompson if Gramecy or any other hip hotel for that matter has room. One very disappointed customer.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-12-05"}

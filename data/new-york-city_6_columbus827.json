{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Does trendy have to mean dim?", "text": "The things that I liked about 6 Columbus include the great location and the great online deal that I got from the hotel's website. I especially loved the discovery of Wholefoods right across the road in Columbus Circle shops - best place for breakfast and snacks.I love the atmosphere of the hotel - very hip and trendy, but I really don't understand why this seems to mean that everything has be kept in semi darkness. Putting on make up in a dimly lit bathroom is a nightmare, and the bedroom itself is little better.Things that I didn't like (other than groping in the dark) are that the room is seriously small with no room for big bags for travellers in the middle of a big trip, and the in room internet is very expensive.There was also an inidentified loud hum that went on all night - possibly a heater or aircon unit outside - either way it had us shopping for earplugs.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-12"}

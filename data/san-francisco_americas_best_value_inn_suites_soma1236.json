{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Poor", "text": "Before leaving home, my trip to SFO was booked at 50%. This hotel was a plan B when I was searching for accommodation. I booked on line (I found pricing high but was last minute). Checking went well though the guy at front desk could be a bit more welcoming. Room looked ok at first sight but once in, I realised that the king-size bed is too huge, a normal queen bed would allow the room to &quot;breathe&quot;. The furnitures need to be refresh, there were spots on the chair, the wall... Shower was not functionnal, toilet blocked the next day, there was no real housekeeping, just making the bed. True, I just needed a bed, I am not looking for perfection, but there was a problem in all aspect, then please just avoid.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_suites_soma", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-09"}

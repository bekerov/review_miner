{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Mikes' the man!!", "text": "We arrived at the hotel after an horrendous arrival at Newark Airport. We had booked transport through Super Shuttle to the hotel. If you like being shouted at by a driver who does 70mph with two fingers on the wheel whilst talking to base then use these guys. They are absolutely awful.However the staff at 414 made up for this. We had arrived from C Rica and my back was playing up. Our room we were told was on the 4th floor with no elevator!!After a bit of rearranging we were given 101 on the ground floor! Thanks.We had in all the rush at the airport left a small bag on the shuttle. Mike and the staff went out of their way to recover this for us but Super Shuttle being what they are we eventually had to go to Queens by train to get it back!!But this hotel and it's staff were really very helpful. A small friendly hotel, not luxury but clean,breakfast eat all you like and a great little kitchenout of hours! Remote didn't work the tele.But hey we wern't there to watch tele.!! Highly recommended.DONT USE SUPER SHUTTLE!!!!!!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-09-05"}

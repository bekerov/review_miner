{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Good location Bad cockroach issue", "text": "I stayed here with 4 girlfriends while in San Francisco for a conference. We were sightseeing prior to the conference and wanted a well-located, cheap place to stay. We were students so the $100/night split amongst 5 ppl was right up our alley. However, the place was old and rundown, it smelled of old wood (a urine-like smell), and there was an abundance of cockroaches in our room. I'd only seen cockroaches once before in my life and my goodness they were everywhere in our room! We discovered the roaches when we tried to move the two twin beds together the first night to have more sleeping space. As we pulled the nightstand away from the wall, the cockroaches scurried everywhere. We only stayed there two nights and then we were able to check into the conference hotel. For graduate students on a tight budget we made do, but now as a working professional I would never lower myself to stay there again.", "hotel": "alexander_inn", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-07"}

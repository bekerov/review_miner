{"city": "chicago", "title": "Small Room Big Location", "text": "We came to Chicago for a conference, which was held at the Sheraton and we were looking to save some money on the room. The location of the hotel was excellent, easy walking distance to lots of restaurants and stores. We walked to the conference and back daily. I have stayed in many a small hotel room in big cities, so opted for the upgraded room size when I booked the Allerton. Well, I would have hated to see the smaller rooms! We were in a corner which was nice, but barely had room to move around the bed. I even went back down to the check-in desk to make sure I got assigned the upgrade, and they were not very nice about it. Well, the upside was the room was clean and convienent. The elevators were very slow and cramped. Good hotel as a home base for sight-seeing or buisness trip, not good if you want to lounge in your room or are traveling with a family. Worked for us for the money, overall.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-23"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Not bad for the price", "text": "My family and I stayed for 1 night and I must say, I had a few reservations after reading the previous reviews. However, the hotel was basic and old but clean. Our bathroom was quite new and very clean. The complimentary breakfast was adequate and there was plenty to fill up on. It was centrally located and an easy walk to Union Square (we have and 8yr old and 5yr old and they managed without a problem). The streets around the hotel werent the best and we made sure we were back indoors before dark. There were a lot of beggars which was intimidating. Overall, if you are looking for somewhere cheap, this hotel is fine. I probably wouldnt stay a week in it but 1 night was fine. Basically, you get what you pay for so dont expect the Ritz.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-07-19"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "great stay (again)", "text": "This was our second visit to Chicago and without a second thought we again chose the Amalfi. Location is perfect for exploring downtown area and around. Really comfortable beds, spacious rooms, complimentary breakfast and of course not forgetting the free drinks and nibbles every evening. I could not fault the hotel at all and could not have asked for more, we will definitely stay here again on any future visits to the city.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-05-03"}

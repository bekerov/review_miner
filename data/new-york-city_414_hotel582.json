{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "A peacefull oasis in a mad city", "text": "I was in New york from the 4 to the 8 of May and stayed at the 414, I, like most others booked this hotel because of reviews on trip advisor. I had been to New York a few years ago and stayed at the Crown Plaza on Times Square, my biggest memory of that time, was the constant noise in the bedroom at night, with Police cars and fire engine claxtons going on all through the night. Not so the 414, the street was not too busy, and when you sat in the courtyard you could have been a million miles from the city. As far as the staff are concerned, they where so friendly and helpfull, again, especially Mike. If you are looking for a small hotel that makes you feel as if you are staying with family, rather than a glass and concrete highrise, this is for you. Good value, clean rooms, nice staff and a peacefull courtyard what more can you ask for. And I have not even mentioned the continental breakfast, the above average size of the bedrooms, the 43&quot; Plasma screen in the rooms, the 2 min. walk to Resturaunt row ( Which Mike will keep you right on where to eat.), or the 10 min walk to Times square. All in all a little Gem in these days of fast foods, fast cars etc, it was nice to feel welcome and wanted. Keep it up Mike, and the rest of the staff at 414, it proves good service does pay.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-05-10"}

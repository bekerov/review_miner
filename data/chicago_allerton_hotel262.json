{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great location good hotel", "text": "We booked two rooms for the last weekend in July 2004, one for our adult children, through a Chicago visitors' area website where we got rates much lower than advertised through the major booking agencies (Orbitz, Expedia, Hotels) or at the hotel's own website. But I had to keep calling to make sure the hotel was holding two rooms, as the hotel kept seeing just one on their records. Interestingly, although we paid the same price for both rooms, one was quite a bit larger with a different room lay-out. Our room was smaller, but with a better view. The good and the bad, with the good first. The staff here is very kind as was previously mentioned. Our room was not ready at 3, which is not surprising considering the generous noon check-out time, but the desk clerk gave us vouchers for free drinks. Then the bar gave us an extra two free drinks for our adult children. They didn't even flinch when I ordered a $9 chocolate martini. Also good--the location is close to everything, the trolley to the Navy Pier, the Gold Coast, the subway, river tours, and it is ON the magnificent mile. If you're a shopper, you'll like it. Although we didn't have a tub, the shower was marble and very chic. The bed was comfortable and they supplied a free relaxation CD kit, which was interesting but not relaxing.  Not so good--the lobby is on the third floor and there are only two elevators to get there, whereupon you have to board another set of elevators to get to your room. We often took the stairs to get to the lobby so not to wait too long. This is not a hotel for kids. There is no pool, which surprised me, this being a four-star hotel and all. The rooms were decorated okay, but a chair was badly stained in the corner of one room. I couldn't see paying full price for this room unless your business is picking up the tab.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-08-07"}

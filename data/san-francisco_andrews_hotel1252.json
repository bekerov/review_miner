{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Good home base", "text": "The Andrews Hotel is very well situated - about 3 blocks from Union Square, and very convenient to all manner of services &amp; restaurants, BART, buses, cable cars, etc. My room was very small, and a bit worn, but basically just fine. The walls are thin, but fortunately the other guests on the floor were quite quiet. There was a nice little LCD TV with DVD player in the room, and you can borrow movies from the front desk. There is free (though unsecured) wireless on every floor. The building is old, and could probably use some new carpet and fresh paint, but it seems very safe and the staff are great. The restaurant on the ground floor (Fino) is very good - a nice place to have a glass of wine and some dinner. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this hotel if you're planning to spend a lot of time in the room, but if you're just looking for a place to get some rest in between SF adventures, this might be the place for you.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-05"}

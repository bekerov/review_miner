{"city": "chicago", "title": "Okay but Small Rooms", "text": "The hotel location was excellent and the proximity to transit was very good. Staff was friendly however I really only had contact on check in. As stated in other reviews the room was tiny. Luckily I was travelling alone, otherwise it would have been too small for two people. Other than that it was adequate and clean. Housekeeping was efficient.Having to take an elevator to the lobby and having to take another to the room was odd but didn't bother me too much. The room overlooked Michigan Avenue so it was a bit noisy but that didn't bother me too much.Other than that I'd have to say that it worked for a quick weekend away but I don't think that I'd feel compelled to stay there again unless I got another great deal.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-28"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "A good choice", "text": "My brother and I stayed there for a quick business/family visit trip in November. The hotel is...really nice. I can't think of anything to complain about. The design isn't groundbreaking, but it is still comfortable and well-done. The location is...perfect. Great shopping, eating, drinking are all just steps away. it's also easy to meet up with friends from all over the City.Our room was much larger than I expected (and who ever says that about a NYC hotel?). It's also nice to be in a busy part of town where the hotel doesn't feel like Grand Central. Also, make sure to eat (even just a snack) at the Thai restaurant on the ground floor...Kittichai?...it's great.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-23"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "my 70th birthday celabration", "text": "My wife and I traveled to Chicago on the 4th of July to the 7th of July. We picked the Amalfi for the price [plane and hotel]. When checking in I found out that the hotel upgraded us to a suite for my birthday. What a nice surprise. The room was huge and the bed was the best we have ever slept in. The shower with two shower heads was just super. Cont. breakfast in a.m. and drinks in p.m. added to the stay. location was great, it took us two days to figure that out. We will try to visit Chicago again and would not hesitate to stay at this fantastic hotel. I rate it 5 stars. george and maureen, plainville ct.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-07-10"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Plain Fun.", "text": "The hotel is located at the end of &quot;restaurant row&quot; in the theater district. It is small 20+ rooms, and there is NO elevator, just stairs up the five stories. The staff is wonderful and courteous. The room was basic, but had 2 standout features: a duvet bedspread(warm and soft) and a flatscreen TV as wide as the bed. The continental breakfast is served in the lobby, and has lots of choices. This hotel is within walking distance of many attractions and theaters. I would stay here again.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-11"}

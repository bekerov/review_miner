{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Nice Hotel but Check Your Credit Card", "text": "Hip, comfortable hotel with friendly, well-trained staff. Rooms are small but well-appointed. Free wireless was nice, but there was no desk to work at, so my laptop truly had to be a laptop. A little hard for the business traveler. The roof bar, reserved for guests and their guests, was a great place to hang out. Location is great for Soho, Tribeca, downtown shopping, eating, and hanging out. The only thing that marred my stay was a $54 charge to my credit card I received a week later in the mail for a &quot;minibar&quot; charge. Since I did not use the minibar at all, I called the reception and the staff person removed the charge (supposedly - I'm waiting for confirmation that my credit card was credited). She did not apologize or say that it may have been their mistake, leaving me with the feeling that she thought I was being dishonest. It's too bad because a simple apology for the misunderstanding would have given them a loyal guest who travels to NYC often. The whole thing leaves me with a bad feeling about the hotel, which is disappointing since the stay itself was quite nice. Check your credit card after you stay there!!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-09-20"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "A nice little midtown treasure", "text": "I go to NYC about once a month for brief business trips. I feel comfortable navigating the city so I don't really care where in Manhattan I stay in terms of location but want to get the best price on a 4 or 5 star hotel. I go for clean and safe which is not easy to find in NYC in anything below a 4 star rated hotel.I chose this hotel because I had a promotional code from Kimpton and the price was under $200 a night. This is a small little place. If you are going for atmosphere in the lobby or a great street, this is not really the right thing. The room was clean and luxurious. The bed was comfortable. The room had a huge flat screen television. My room was on the 7th floor and faced Park Avenue and was actually quite noisy. Other than that, it was a great, clean, nice place to stay. The staff was very friendly. The location is great, a couple of blocks down the street from Grand Central. I would definitely stay there again.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-28"}

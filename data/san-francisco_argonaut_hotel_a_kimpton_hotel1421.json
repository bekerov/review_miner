It's right on Fisherman's Wharf and only steps away from shopping, restaurants and attractions.The hotel itself is very clean and comfortable. I wouldn't recommend taking a car there if you can avoid it. If I remember correctly, parking is $40.00 per night.The hotel staff are very professional and really try to make you feel like a guest.They do have a computer in the lobby you can use to check email, etc.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-28"}

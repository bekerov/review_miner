{"city": "chicago", "title": "There are many better hotels", "text": "Stayed one night on a business trip because most everything else was booked. Had a queen room at $199. It was TINY -- barely enough room to walk around the bed, and there was no way two people couild have used that room. Bed was comfortable but the plumbing was noisy all night long. Bathroom was roomy and well lighted -- quite nice. Only one chair, a straight back desk chair. Hi speed internet at $9.95/day. No newspaper in the morning, front desk was courteous but understaffed -- never more than one person on duty to handel checkins/checkouts, andswer phone, etc.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-09-30"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great old hotel", "text": "This is a great old hotel, located on a nice corner of Michigan Ave and Huron. (a little noisy, but we sleep with a fan, so that helped) The staff is very kind and they try hard to meet your travel needs. I would warn anyone who is thinking about staying here, though, the less expensive rooms are very very very very very small, so we had to upgrade to a suite, which was very nice, but of course, more expensive. But nice. Nicest bed I have ever slept in, as far as a hotel goes. If you aren't a TV watcher, the smaller room would be okay, but if you like to watch TV, you will be disappointed, cause for some strange reason, they put the TV's to the side of the bed.......I don't know about you, but I like to get under the covers and surf chanels at night, and you would break your neck watching TV if you stayed in the smaller rooms. The suite had the TV located at the end of the bed, making much more sense and nicer on the neck! Also, the restaurant in the hotel is nice for breakfast, but don't order dinner there. UGH. This really is a nice old hotel, but it is geared to older adults, not much there for little ones or teenagers, so if you are an older adult who likes old hotels with great location...this is the place for you. I will stay there again, but this time, I know to order a suite!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-08-01"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Really friendly and helpful staff b", "text": "I've just returned from a fabulous week in New York. Had read reviews for 414 before I went so was hoping everything good that had been said about it was true. I was not disappointed. The hotel is small but very friendly. All the staff were lovely and very helpful with helping us book trips and making our stay comfortable. We stayed in the apartment at the back which was quieter, although did hear the main door closing as guests came and went in the night, but with earplugs I wasn't disturbed! Lots of places to eat on the doorstep as the 414 is on &quot;restaurant row&quot;. I would recommend The Joshua Tree just along in the next block on the way to Times Square; very friendly staff and food is good (especially the fish and chips!). The only problem we had was one night when the heating wasn't working but that was all fine the next day. The rooms were clean but nothing fancy so don't expect anything too luxurious. Breakfast was provided every morning which consisted of huge croissants, muffins, rolls and spreads, and cereals, which set us up for most of the day. Locaqtion was brilliant - right in the centre of everything only being a short walk from Times Square and Rockefeller Centre. I would definately go back to this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-09"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "On the Way Down", "text": "We got the idea of staying at the 414 Inn in NYC from this site. Most of the comments were comfortable, quiet, clean with a European flair. We could still see a lot of this, but have to report that it is on its way down and becomming seedy. We believe that this is because the ideas might have been in the brain of the hotel manager, Mike, and he died suddelnly a few months ago. One can see the changes. The carpets are showing dirt, the court yard. though still pleasant. has dead plants and the lobby, just turning shappy. I hope someone quickly comes in as it could easily still be turned around.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-08-10"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Does not Honour Online Booking", "text": "There is always a first time for everything -&gt; Refusal of Service.Arrived at 6:30PM at night, showed our web reservation printout and was asked for name three times before saying no reservation under the name. He takes a look at the web reservation sheet of ours and tells us that the rates are all wrong (too low). However, he was &quot;willing to accomodate&quot; and put us in a room although the hotel is &quot;full&quot;. Hands us a sheet with no explaination (apparently guest registration sheet), asked us to fill out information and sign first before he starts filling out the length of stay and room rates (which of course were higher than the web reservation). When I mentioned that the rates (only approx. 10 dollars more for two days in comparison to web reservation ) will not be accepted by us and that this is a problem he should take up with EconoLodge Headquarters, he said plain and simple &quot;...then go away, we don't serve you, you are rude, go away! Leave now!&quot; At no time were we rude. At no time did we agree to pay more regardless of the amount. We asked for the registration sheet to be torn up and he refused. Bottom Line:1. Poor Language Communication Skills (hard to understand his Enlish)2. Poor Attitude (at no time did he make a phone call/use a computer to verify the validity of our web reservation)3. Does not understand the concept of customer service Side Note: There are about 12 parking spots for &quot;big&quot; cars and about another 12 spots for compact cars (for compact cars, 2 inches from the mirror of each side for a Toyota Corolla is the space you are left with if you are confident enough to steer into that space)", "hotel": "alpha_inn_and_suites_san_francisco", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-02-16"}

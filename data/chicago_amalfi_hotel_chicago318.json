{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great location and service but nothing to do with the Amalfi Coast", "text": "This is a very nice option to take advantage of the many amenities Chicago has to offer. It has a great location and the greeters up front are very helpful. It does certainly add to the safety factor that they recognize and greet all hotel guests.The cocktail reception was very good, but our advice is skip the signature Limoncello Martini, we and not anyone that was around us cared for it, and we love lemoncello! We would have much preferred a cold limoncello shot the way they are actually served on the Amalfi Coast.Breakfast was also good with tasty options, but not having a simple toaster, was a drawback.The rooms while small are very comfortable, and very nicely appointed. There was a party in a room adjoining us, which sometimes got loud, but the room was really pretty soundproof considering the noise of the party.As past visitors to the Amalfi Coast, why this hotel is named after that area was beyond us. Besides a couple of pictures, there was absolutely nothing about the hotel that resembled the Amalfi Coast,. We kind of expected the bright blues, yellows and whites that adorn most of the decor of that area. Not even one ceramic piece of decoration for which they are famous.The Amalfi Coast should complain, really if anyone travels their expecting boring beige, browns and dull burnt orange colors, they may be overloaded by the spectacular beauty of the region.We went over to HUB 51 for lunch, which is a wonderful alternative to the touristy joints, like Harry Carry's. It is also across the street, just the opposite corner and down a block.Had much more eclectic menu options.They are running great deals right now, I know Travelzoo's rate was $94 which was a value that can't be beat.Overall, not our favorite, but we would return for a good rate.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-02-21"}

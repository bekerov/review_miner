{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "The Staff Shines", "text": "Just returned from 5 nights at 6 Columbus. A few highs and lows, but overall very pleased. The staff from front desk to housekeeing couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. The young men at the front door that help with luggage and cabs etc. were a delight. They were bright, polite, friendly, well groomed and well trained. Rooms are small, but well designed. Beds are very comfy! A small desk and chair in the rooms would make a great difference. Lighting in the rooms and bathrooms is very inadequate. Mood lighting just doesn't cut it when you're in the shower or shaving. Can't see instructions for use of the room safe on floor of closet because of lack of light. Overall, I liked it and would go back. Kudos to staff and people who picked and trained them.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-01"}

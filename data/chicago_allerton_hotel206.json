{"city": "chicago", "title": "lovely hotel great location", "text": "We stayed here for two nights after flying in from uk, and before travelling on into america. We thought the hotel was very nice, staff were helpful and friendly. The room was very clean and quite adiquate in size. I don't know why any one should complain about this hotel as we found it to be perfect for our needs, some people are very hard to please if they did not like this place. The location is ideal for sight seeing in chicago. there is also a little bit of history with the hotel which makes it all the more appealing.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-09-20"}

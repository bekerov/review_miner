{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Smelly Building and No A/C!", "text": "This was not one of the best overnight places to stay in S.F.The building had a very bad smell, my husband described it as having &quot;an onion in a headlock&quot;. Luckily there was a Walgreens across the street and we were able to buy some disinfectant/air freshener spray. We stayed at this place because a representative from AAA recomended it. I have two small children and our room had large windows with no screens. I was very tense about having a toddler in this room because she kept wanting to look out the window. Also Lombard Street is very noisy at night making it hard to sleep.There was no A/C so the room was very stuffy. Another family we came with had no hot water in there room for about 20 minutes. There was no continental breakfast in the morning only coffee and juice.Our family was very disappointed and will never stay at this place again.", "hotel": "alpha_inn_and_suites_san_francisco", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-06"}

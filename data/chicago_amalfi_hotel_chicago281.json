{"city": "chicago", "title": "Chic Hip Hotel with great service and amenities", "text": "During our stay, we were greeted and checked in with a hotel associate. Their out of the box check in made us feel like we were their only priority. Staff was knowledgeable, courteous and helpful with directions and giving suggestions on places to go. Unfortunately, there is no lounge or restaurant; however, they do accomodate their guests with a happy hour everyday. We received 4 tickets which entitled you to drinks and complimentary appetizers. The room was spacious and designed with modern decor. It was clean and ready unpon our arrival. We enjoyed our stay and plan to go back very soon! Although it's located off the beaten path (not directly on Michigan Ave) it is very close.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-08"}

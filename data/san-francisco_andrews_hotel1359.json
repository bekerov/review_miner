{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "A cute and comfortable place to stay", "text": "This really is a cute place. Granted, the rooms are small, and the bathrooms are tiny, but it is clean and very friendly. The desk clerks were all very helpful, including a smile and a nod the second time I came in through the front door. They recognized me already. This place reminds me of a small European hotel, really unlike what you would find most places in the US. The location is fine, and the price is good. You might do a bit better pricewise in the neighborhood, but I have no idea what the places would be like. I'll come back here again.

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Disgusting.", "text": "My fiancee and I were looking so forward to this trip , but were sadly disappointed.We were greeted with rotting food in the refrigerator. We called down to the front desk and they sent up a maintenance person, who cleaned out the refrigerator, and sprayed what appeared to be Febreze. No offer of a new room whatsoever. No apology. We settled in and realized there was no hairdryer.Our problems seemed to be over until we were greeted at 3 a.m. with the smell of cigarette smoke in our bathroom and hotel room. Regardless if it was a smoking floor or not, we were not notified. Other guests on the floor clearly took &quot;smoking floor&quot; literally and two afternoons in a row, the smell of marijuana smoke poured into our room.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-25"}

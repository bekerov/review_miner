{"city": "chicago", "title": "Charming place", "text": "I really liked the feel of this place. It was quite the opposite of the corporate soulless megahotel: you got the sense of someone having thought all the details through very carefully. I liked particularly the lack of the mean-spiritedness one quite often finds in large US hotels: there's no feeling that the whole hotel experience has been crafted to extract as much from you by way of 'extras' as possible. There's no charge for internet access (free wifi in rooms); breakfast is included; and they even offer cocktails every evening (and don't seem to mind if you just swipe one and head for your room). The breakfast set-up wouldn't suit those keen on serious eating in the morning, but I really liked the self-service arrangement on each floor, so you could just wander out for coffee without getting dressed. I found the staff exceptionally friendly, helpful, and professional. I'd definitely go back.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-09"}

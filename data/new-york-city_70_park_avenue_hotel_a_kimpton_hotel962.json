{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "nice location good value", "text": "70 Park is a nice hotel. The rooms are small, but this is NYC. I would decrib the decor as grandma chic. Our room had a 42 in flat screen, ipod docking station, wine glasses and a comfy bed. The staff was very accomdating, from the doorman helping with parking to security helping return my wife's wallet which she left in the safe. The hotel offers a wine hour at 5pm in lobby for free, which is a nice touch. There was also free coffee and tea in the morning. Location is about two block from Grand Central Station, which is cool place to check out. Went to the Oyster Bar very old school, worth the walk.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-03-01"}

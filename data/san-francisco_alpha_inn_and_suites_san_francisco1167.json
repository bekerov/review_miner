{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Terrible", "text": "What a horrible experience!The room was very smelly, there were spider webs on walls and a hole in the celling with dust falling from it, the bathroom wasn't clean...Futhermore, the owner is not reliable AT ALL!! We booked the room many months before the trip, for 7 nights, but we had to cancel one night in the week. We called a few weeks before the trip and the owner told us the cancellation for this night was ok. At the check in, he kept tolding us that the cancellation wasn't possible and that we had to pay for the night even if we weren't there (and even if we called before). And we can't argue with him because he can't speak in english !! So we had to pay for his lie, in addition of a bad stay at this hotel.Don't go there... even for the &quot;low price&quot;. Find something else, pay a little more or stay at home!", "hotel": "alpha_inn_and_suites_san_francisco", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-07"}

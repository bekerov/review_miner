{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great experience in Chicago", "text": "This hotel is in a wonderful location for sightseeing, shopping, walking to good restaurants, etc. The employees are very cordial and eager to help you with hotel procedures, find any information you need about Chicago, and do that extra thing that makes your day easier. Even though my husband and I could be their parents they showed no age bias or impatience with us. The breakfast buffet has a good selection and is served on each floor, and the evening reception is a nice way to wind down. I would definitely recommend the Amalfi.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-01-31"}

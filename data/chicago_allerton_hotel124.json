{"city": "chicago", "title": "Pleasantly surprised", "text": "I stayed for two nights on business. I was worried after reading the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. The room was not big, but perfect for one person or a for couple for a short stay. It was recently remodelled: I liked the style and the bed was very comfortable. The position is great, right in the middle of the Miracle Mile. The building's architecture is beautiful.The only issue I had were the elevators: sometimes there was a short wait because two elevators were not available for guests.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-20"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "One of the cleanest and artsiest hotels I've ever stayed at.", "text": "One thing I noticed at first was the hotel's design aesthetic. Loved the lobby and the hallways and it reflected on the rooms as well. The rooms were not too big nor small, were extremely clean and has enough amenities to make a week's stay worth it: a couple of TVs, a sofa bed plus your regular bed, L'Occitane bath items, work desk, hair dryer, iron, etc. Bathroom was clean and well-stocked. Our room had a good view of Chicago and when we asked for additional pillows, they responded quickly as well. It made my stay in Chicago better.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-03-02"}

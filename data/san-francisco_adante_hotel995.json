{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Cute Boutique Hotel", "text": "Stayed here with friends for the SF Marathon. LOVED IT! We got the king junior suite that gave us a separate living room with a pull out sofa bed. I loved the wall paintings! Room was very clean and staff was nice and respectful. The only small complaint was the view: we had none! Also, I had to pay about $20 for parking but that is standard in SF--at least they provided parking! Great budget hotel for the frugal traveler.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-20"}

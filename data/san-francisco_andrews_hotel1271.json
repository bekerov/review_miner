{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "A Very Lovely Hotel", "text": "We stayed at the Andrews Hotel for one night in November 2008. We had two rooms, my husband and I in a Cozy Double and our friends in a room with two twins. I had read all the reviews on this site so I was prepared for noise at night. However, our rooms faced the back alley and other than normal night city noise we all slept well. We found the beds comfortable. I will agree with other reviewers that our bathroom in the Cozy Double room was very small and a person larger than myself would have trouble using the toilet and perhaps shower. Our friends in the twin room had a much larger bathroom so I have to think if you request a bigger bathroom the staff would be accomodating. Breakfast in the morning was great, muffins, scones, pastries, fruit, coffee, tea and OJ---and all right outside your room!The free wine in the restaurant was such a nice touch and we sat talking at the bar for a long time and no one seemed to mind. We ended up eating at Fino and it was delicious. The front desk attendant was very helpful and got us ice several times. Also, the parking seemed to be the same price as the lots we saw around the area and very nice because they valet it for you. We would stay at the Andrews again in a heartbeat. The price is so reasonalbe and the hotel is charming on top of it!", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-26"}

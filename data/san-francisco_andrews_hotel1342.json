{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Nice Historic property Great Value", "text": "I stayed at the property Sept 27-30, 2005. As a business traveller I was a bit concerned. The location was about 3 blocks from Union Square, and a 15 minute walk to Moscone Convention Center (I just did the 3 minute walk to the Westin and took the free convention bus to Moscone CC). Pluses: cheap dry cleaner next door (with next day service), wireless internet service ($10/day, some people can pick it up for free, but I couldn't), within 3 blocks of Union Square, in theatre district, on bus route, great &quot;european&quot; breakfast every morning (plus coffee, tea available all day), free glass of wine every evening, room was quiet (didn't hear neighbours, but traffic was horrendeous, so bring earplugs). Negs: tiny room, very small desk, 12&quot; tv, tiny bathrooom, internet not free, loud street noise (had no a/c, so you have to keep the window open). Overall for the price.. Great Deal (better than paying 2x-3x the price at the Westin or Sheraton down the street (especially if you are only going to use your room to sleep in, plus you get a free breakfast).", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-10-13"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Really great boutique hotel", "text": "We stayed here for four nights in October and had a great time. The location is excellent -- perfectly situated for Theatre and dining. And if you're into walking (as we are), well, it's in the middle of the city.The staff is very nice and the rooms are relatively roomy and very clean (just make sure you get up before 1pm -- the cleaning staff is not onsite 24 hours). What more can you ask for? Great value with respect to the area. Highly recommended!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-11-03"}

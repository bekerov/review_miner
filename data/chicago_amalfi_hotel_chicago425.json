{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Stay at the Amalfi", "text": "My family and I recently travelled to Chicago for a 4 day stay. We thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. The location is excellent. We were able to walk to the shopping at Magnificent Mile and the Navy Pier. In addition we walked to the theatre district to see Wicked. The hotel is so close to the above sites if you are tired and choose to take a cab, the fare is only about $5.The room size was comfortable and clean. Continental breakfast every morning was adequate and managers reception with wine and cheese in the evening was a nice touch. The hotel is right next door to Keefers Steakhouse which was very good. Also across the street is Harey Careys which was also a fun restaurant. Numerous eateries are within walking distance. I highly recommend Amalfi's on your next trip to Chicago.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-07-31"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Nice but Lout", "text": "This hotel has a perfect location. We stayed at the hotel when they had full occupency The elevators are small but there are several of them. It only took a minute for one to come by. The rooms and bathrooms were standard hotel rooms for a big city. If you want a larger hotel room you should probably stay outside of Chicago. The staff were very courteous. You can hear sirens and beeping cars (Again, you are in Chicago.). My only complaint is the lack of wireless internet service in rooms.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-05-22"}

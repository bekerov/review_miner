{"city": "chicago", "title": "good location bad situation", "text": "The beds felt as if they were recovered from a 1920's brothel. Very saggy and limp. The mirrors on the ceiling were an interesting touch. As were the additional bedfellows. I believe our room had a mother nest filled with her baby cockroaches. At one point during the night, one even fell of the wall and landed on my lip. The tickling sensations i had throughout the night were not always coming from my bed partner. the decor was fashioned with an 80's flair of stucco walls and well worn carpeting seamingly of the same era. The antiquated bathroom did release good strong hot water, but was slightly cramped for two. if you don't mind the smell of stale locker rooms, than the trip to your room through the halls should bring back some fond memories of your high school gym days. However, the staff at the abbot hotel is very pleasant and professional even under these dire working conditions. My recomendation to all is that it has a great convenient location for many of the city sites especially within the lakeview neighborhood,and offers a vey competetive room rate. I also recommend that your bring a can of raid to eliminate any additioal charges for having those addititional roomates.", "hotel": "abbott_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-08-30"}

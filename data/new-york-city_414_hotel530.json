{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "This place is a little gem", "text": "This hotel is a little gem. It's a converted townhouse with about 16 rooms, just across from 'Restaurant Row' You're only 5 minutes from Broadway, and 10/15 mins from Rockefeller Centre, Macy's, and the Empire State Building. Central Park is approximately a 20 minute walk, although the buses and underground are quick and convenient. The hotel is small, but everyone friendly and helpful - any problems at all and they were happy to oblige. The rooms are good sized, clean and comfortable (very comfortable beds for the weary traveller) and there is complementary breakfast in a morning as well as free internet use for guests in the lobby. This hotel is a welcome change from the big impersonal hotels you see all too often these days, highly recommended - we loved it.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-02"}

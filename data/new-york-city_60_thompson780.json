{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Ultra-posh good experience", "text": "Although there were some mixed reviews about 60 Thompson on this site, we booked a King Supreme room to house my family of 4 for 5 days (2 adults, one infant, one 2 year old.)The hotel is over the top posh, but the service(contrary to prior posts) was excellent. Despite being a dominantly upwardly mobile single crowd staying there, we still felt some warmth both from the staff and patrons. When our baby girl cried for hours on early morning, we received a call/complaint that was very understanding. We can't blame the neighbors for complaining- she does cry quite loudly. The location is fantastic, especially if you aren't doing the whole midtown tourist thing. Soho is great for shopping. There are tons of great restaurants in the neighborhood. And after walking around NYC day after day, the hotel provided a satisfying respite.The hotel looks good, but some of the furniture in the rooms show a bit of wear- inevitable. I think we even caused some 'wear' ourselves. Positive experience for us. We would be happy to go back.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-10-07"}

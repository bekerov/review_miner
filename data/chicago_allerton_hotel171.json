{"city": "chicago", "title": "Only thing good about this hotel is the location DON'T STAY AT THE ALLERTON", "text": "Checked in at the Allerton having requested a non-smoking room. Went to the room only to find that it was a smoking room. It took 15-20 minutes to get a non-smoking room, with discourteous staff. Stayed at this hotel for a wedding anniversary celebration with many other friends and family. That is the only reason we stayed. The windows in our room were so filthy that you could not see out of them (spider webs and dirt). Hallways outside of the room were filthy as well. I have stayed at hundreds of other hotels for business, and found this one to be the worst one at which I have ever stayed. Food at the Hotel was, at best, mediocre. When I complained about the FILTHY conditions of the Allerton Hotel, I was told that I should expect that due to the age of the hotel. A major downer in a great city.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-05"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Quaint and 'character' don't cut it.", "text": "In reference to the other reviews. Yes- the elevators are Sloooow. Yes- The rooms are small and/or oddly configured. Yes- The desk staff is rather abrupt in a polished quit bugging me kind of way. Getting pillows was an all day affair(the ones they had were small &amp; hard and we were short 1). The sink kind of worked, the toilet flush was a trickle and then the tank trickled for the next 1/2 hour. This is a hotel designed in the early last century and it shows throughout. Towels were also a struggle. We had to ask for additional towels every day, apparently there is a new shortage of hotel towels that is causing them to stockpile any and all. 3 in a room and 2 towels just doesn't work. Interior of the rooms is dated and a bit depressing, but I guess that's supposed to add to the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of this &quot;character&quot; hotel. Experienced travellers will find this hotel disappointing and those looking for a weekend in Chicago can do much better for only a few $$ more.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-03-30"}

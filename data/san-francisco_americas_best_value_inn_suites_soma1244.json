{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "A Hotel Experience to Forget", "text": "NOTHING IS ACCEPTABLE at this hotel, which seems like a family business. It was a child of about 10 years of age who checked us in. The lobby is small, looks very old, and unclean. The shower and telephone did not work; the TV doesn't even have a remote. The location is completely &quot;offside&quot;, as it is located on a dark and sparse little street. My advice to other travelers: DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_suites_soma", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-22"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great stay with family", "text": "Stayed here with three children in late December, 2003. Location is great for American Girl Place and other shopping. Staff was really outstanding to the children, providing us with &quot;front of the line&quot; passes for Walnut Room and coupons for Hancock tower. Very friendly. Also, my Priority Club gold got us an upgraded room. Late December is not a busy time so rooms were probably more available, and ours was wonderful. All this at a ridiculously low internet rate. But I was most impressed at how comfortable I felt staying there with children.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-02-21"}

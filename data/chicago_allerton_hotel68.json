{"city": "chicago", "title": "A few problems but a good stay", "text": "I booked at the Allerton because it was only a few blocks from my destination - the Northwestern Univ. Hospital which is right down Huron Street. Despite the street work right outside the hotel, I didn't have any problem with the valet parking. I booked a Park and Play rate that included the parking and put the room rate (for a King nonsmoking room) at about $120 - not bad for downtown Chicago. The room was small-ish, but I've had smaller rooms in Chicago. The closet was spacious enough and the bath was tiny but serviceable. Amenities were nice and the room, carpet to ceiling, was clean. My biggest gripe was with the internet site and connection. Their website is very difficult to navigate with different versions of reservation's pages depending on what kind of package you choose. It's poorly designed. Once on site, the internet is supposed to be available for $9.95 a night, which I always find surprising when you can get free internet now at so many other locations. I was still going to pay it but then couldn't get on. The front desk passed me off to a &quot;tech support&quot; person who tried for 10 minutes to get me signed on. I finally just said &quot;Never mind.&quot; They slid my bill under the door overnight and I noticed that - besides the Park and Play rate - they had charged also for parking! I immediately called the front desk and was told, &quot;Well, they fix that on check-out.&quot; Like I would know that? The location, right on Michigan Ave. is great - a few blocks either way and you're in shopping nirvana. If I go back there though, I think I might try the Avenue hotel just down the block (after I check out its reviews, of course!).", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-03-10"}

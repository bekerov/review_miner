{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Boutique done right!", "text": "My wife and I where staying in the city for a family function and just came back from a 3 night stay at the hotel. Unlike a lot of boutique hotels in the city the vibe of the 60 Thompson was different. The lobby didn't feel like a nightclub that Phillipe Starck designed as most do. The staff was very attentive to servicing the customer instead of trying to grab a modeling or acting job and amenities felt well placed and relevant. The rooms albeit small (as most rooms in NYC are) where well appointed with fantastic toiletries, min-bar delights and electronics. The night housekeeping staff was even so kind to clean our room, turn down the bed, and replace all of the old towels while we where out to dinner in the city. (We haphazardly left the do not disturb sign on the door). I will definetely stay when I get back as I finally found a hotel in the cty that I would like to frequent vs. searching for that next place.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-01-30"}

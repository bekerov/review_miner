{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Enjoyed Our Stay", "text": "We stayed at The Andrews Hotel during our honeymoon through the US and it was nice but very small.The rooms, bathrooms and decor are very outdated and tiny - you really don't have any room to move. The bed was uncomfortable - lumpy matress.Breakfast was nice but was really a first in first served kind of thing as it was set up on a buffet in the hallway of each floor, consisting of pastries, fruit, tea and coffee, so what you got often depended upon how early or late you got up!Overall the stay at the The Andrews was ok but we have stayed at much nicer hotels in San Francisco.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-19"}

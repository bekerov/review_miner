{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Brilliant location", "text": "We were really pleased with the Adante hotel. The location is great - you are 5 minutes from Union Square and it is on a bus route and handy for cable cars too. You felt safe walking around the area day and night, important as we had a teenager with us. We had two rooms, painted with a jungle theme to put you in the holiday mood. Whilst the rooms were a little tired, they were clean and offer good value for money. Breakfast was pretty basic - toast and muffins, but stoked you up for a while. Tony on the front desk was really helpful and offered good advice about the city. The restaurant across the road from the hotel does lovely food and the internet cafe is handy for coffee and even more muffins.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-08-23"}

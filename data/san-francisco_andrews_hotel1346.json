{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "We'll come back !", "text": "Andrews is a very nice hotel, well situated in Post Street so that you can visit a part of SF by walking (Downtown, Nob Hill, Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf)Our room was very nice but small (but it was the first price). However we had 2 good and quiet nights.The staff is very friendly and will do his best to help you. A continental breakfast is served between 7 and 9 on each floor.Just a word about Fino, the italian restaurant in the hotel, which is really excellent (around 60$ for 2 with wine).We decided to come back in SF, as we really enjoy the city. We'll certainly return to Andrews, it's a great value.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-08-15"}

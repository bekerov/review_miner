{"city": "chicago", "title": "Some things great other things not so great", "text": "We stayed here for two nights in September of 2005 for our anniversary. This hotel was ranked #3 and I got it for about $200/night so I was stoked.Good = Room was very nice. Bed extremely comfortable. Liked the style of the placeOkay = Breakfast was raved about by other reviewers, but I found it to be average.Not Good = Front desk service was nonexistent at midnight. It was frustrating because we were looking for late night dining options. Ended up just not getting anything. I wish the location was a block or two closer to the Mag Mile area. It was 8-9 blocks from the water tower. State Street ain't Michigan Ave.We didn't do the experience designer thing, because we're from the area and pretty much knew what we were going to do.Overall, I would stay here again, but would explore other options first.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-11"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Narrow but nice", "text": "This is a very nice hotel. We stayed at various (pricier) four star hotels in Chicago, and one has to admit that these Hotels offer spacier rooms (although often not that much) and some more amenities that may not be that important (such as a tiny swimming pool).The location is excellent. Rooms are clean and tastefully decorated. As noted in other reviews, they are small and the ceiling is rather low (same in halls and elevators), so if you are taller than 6.5 foot and/or weigh more than 300 lbs, you may want to go elsehere. The room service is prompt and courteous. I had a standard room and later, we moved (because my family with 2 little kids joined) into a suite, which had spectacular views from windows directed towards the West, North and East ... I am not sure if you can find something similar in any other Chicago Hotel.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-06-10"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Cute Hotel- Centrally Located", "text": "Centrally located to Grand Central, in midtown, away from the craziness of Times Square, 70 Park Avenue is a great little hotel. The lobby and rooms are small, but cozy. The staff was really friendly and accommodated my need for an earlier check-in. I love Kimptons because most of them have ipod docking stations and easy (free!) internet access. My only complaint is that the service at the Silver Leaf Tavern (hotel restaurant next door) wasn't the greatest.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-03-16"}

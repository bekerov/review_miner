{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great botique hotel!", "text": "This hotel was great - In a great area right downtown and close to everything. The daily happy hour had great food, wine and premium liquors. The free breakfast was even better! Actually I believe everything was included breakfast/happy hour/business center/WiFi.Our room was a king size facing the back of the building. Really clean new and comfortable. Small touches such as books and cds to enjoy made the room feel less like a hotel - Would highly recommend.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-12-07"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Good Value", "text": "Room was clean, staff was very friendly and helpful. No problem getting a late check-out. Location is decent for cruising the wharf- about 1.5 mile walk to the action, about 2 miles to Alcatraz Ferry. Never felt uncomfortable walking alone in the daytime, however I did not walk at night so don't know about that. I had a room close to Lombard so it was a bit noisy, but turning on the fan or AC effectively drowned that out. If you don't mind walking this is a great place to stay and save money by not renting a car.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-15"}

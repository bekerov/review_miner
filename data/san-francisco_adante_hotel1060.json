{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "My new favorite in Union Square", "text": "Of all the hotels I've stayed at in SF the Adante is the best in terms of value. I paid $64.80 for a room for one night. They honored my request for the top floor at the back. Room 710 contained two double beds, the usual furnishings, a safe, newly remodelled bathroom with all new fixtures, hair dryer, iron and ironing board. Walls were handpainted with rural scenes and tropical fish--not very well done but it gave the room some character. With the ceiling fan and the window cracked open there was plenty of ventilation. I couldn't believe how quiet it was. With the window open all night I heard nothing beyond the occasional siren in the distance. The location is great, a few blocks from Union Square. I went to the Curran Theater that night so after the play it was nice to able to walk home in less than 5 minutes. The breakfast was skimpy, just muffins toast and coffee, but at this price I think that's acceptable. There are many good coffee shops nearby if you need more. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. I can't imagine finding a better deal in San Francisco.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-11-04"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "great location and good amenities", "text": "The Allerton was everything I expected. The location was fantastic. All major tourist attractions were within walking distance.The check-in desk was helpful in that even though we arrived early (11am), we were able to check in and go to our rooms right away, giving us plenty of time to rest before venturing out. Elevators can be a problem even though we were lucky enough to never wait more than 5 mins for it. I'd say avoid checking in and out at around 5pm. There was a pretty big elevator and bell-man shortage. As long as you avoid the busy times, the service is good and elevators are sufficient.All in all, I'd return for another stay, especially since getting such a good deal from travelocity.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-24"}

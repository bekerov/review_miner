{"city": "chicago", "title": "Fabulous Location at a Great Price", "text": "After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, I was a bit skeptical about this property. However the rate I obtained on Hotwire ($139/nt) was too good to pass up. Don't know where all the negative comments were coming from. I had no issues whatsoever with the elevator. It was always quick to arrive. Yes, the room was small, but I was expecting that. For one person it was perfect. It was renovated and tastefully decorated. The marble bathroom had a nice sized shower with great water pressure and amenities from La Occitane. The location can't be beat and my room overlooked Michigan Ave. I don't know if there is a better buy on the Magnificent Mile.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-22"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Expect Little and You'll be Satified", "text": "We are a family of three (adults with a &quot;tween&quot;) and have stayed at two other hotels on the Mag Mile during previous Chicago trips. This, by far, was our least liked hotel. First the good stuff: superb access to the Mag Mile, tons of shopping, easy access to CTA bus routes, nearby restaurants and access to tourist attractions. And it was clean.Dislikes: 1) Very difficult check in...we had to make our way through a huge crowd in the lobby only to have to lug stuff to the second floor.2) Bank of FIVE elevators and only ONE working. And the six foot by five foot (no kidding!) elevator only accommodates five people with luggage.3) Garbage left in the hallway for two days.4) Concierge who told us he didn't have what we were looking for -- ask at the front desk. This AFTER the front desk referred us to the non-helpful concierge.5) Tiny room...we called ahead and told them we were a family of three. The king room was recommended. Our mouths dropped open when we saw how tiny it was. Hardly any room to walk around the bed when we placed our baggage on the side of the room.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who has a wheelchair -- I have no idea how you'd move around in the five foot wide hallways.And, unless you can afford a suite, I wouldn't recommend this to families at all. You just do not have the space to relax. You are right on top of each other after a day of walking around the city and navigating the population out on one of Chicago's biggest avenues.Oh, and PS...we knew they didn't have a pool BUT they said they recommended a daily pass at the nearby health club. Um...that health club was closed and has been for months. :( Thank goodness we could walk to the Oak Street beach.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-18"}

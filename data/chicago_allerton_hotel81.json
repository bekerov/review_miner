{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great little place!", "text": "I booked a King room under a special rate for Saturday the 13th of December. Excellent $99 rate plus tax for King room. The building itself is RIGHT OFF the magnificent mile and smack in the middle of everything. Cute renovated interior - very small elevators but not a problem if you have light luggage. Nice looking front desk /restaurant and bar area. Nicely decorated room - good sized with room to walk about. Nice bathroom -small but not too cramped. Room overall is clean and cheery - not dark. Save on parking-use the structure attatched to the hospital a block away ($38.00 for 24 hrs) and walk to the Allerton. My only complaints are the following: 1) The bed though big and nice with nice sheets and pillows is very HARD. Not a problem if you like hard mattresses of course, but I prefer a softer one with pillowtop. 2) Although it was winter - it was hot in the room. I turned the thermostat down to 65 but still was warm all night. Admittedly I like to sleep when it's colder so I realize not everyone will care about this. The windows do open but only about an inch as there were not any screens on them. 3) Breakfast at the restaurant was outrageous in price. $44 for 2 orders of bacon(4 strips each), one order of toast, 3 pancakes, and 2 glasses orange juice!! Eat elsewhere but don't be afraid of the comfortable accommidations. Free coffee in the lobby in mornings and free hot chocolate near reception during the holidays!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-12-15"}

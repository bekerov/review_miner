{"city": "chicago", "title": "Nice hotel great location good price", "text": "Stayed at the Allerton this past weekend. Received a notice from Travelzoo about a good weekend deal that turned out to be $108 per night. Turned out to be perfect. At $108 per night, our expections weren't very high. Yes, the rooms are small and it's an older hotel but I found it to be clean and the staff to be friendly. The hotel is in a great location for access to Chicago's tourist spots. We were able to walk to Millenium Park, the Hancock Center, Navy Pier, the St. Pat's parade and the numerous restuarants and clubs in the area. We didn't shop but Michigan Ave appears to have everything covered there from Tiffany's to Saks to Brooks Brother, Apple, etc. A previous poster mentioned the 3rd floor lobby as a negative. We found it to be a positve. It's off the street and was a pleasant surprise. The lounge on the second floor was also very nice. Great bartender. We didn't use the restaurant. There are many, many hotels within a few blocks of the Allerton. My guess is that the rates on those are much higher. If you're looking at a short stay and are looking for a decent hotel, i'd recommend the Allerton. We took some other advice and took the Blue Line train from the airport. It was inexpensive compared to a taxi but it takes forever to get downtown. I counted 19 stops on the train. You then have to transfer to the red line for 5 more stops and then walk about 1/4 mile. Returning to the airport on Sunday was comical. The traiin became so crowded that people couldn't get on the train at stops on the way. Next time we visit Chicago, we'll take a taxi.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-03-19"}

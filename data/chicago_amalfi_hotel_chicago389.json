{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Little Hotel!", "text": "My fiance and I visited Chicago for a long weekend back in May. We stumbled upon the Amalfi online - the location was good, the price was in our budget, and I wanted to stay in a boutique hotel so we picked it. The room was spacious and the best part was the complimentary breakfast! Saved us time in the morning - we just grabbed a coffee, banana, and muffin and went sightseeing! If I was going to visit Chicago again (which I would!) I would recommend staying here!!!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-07"}

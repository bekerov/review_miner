{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Friendly atmosphere clean room great view. We loved it.", "text": "We didn't know quite what to expect with the Argonauts 'Nautical theme'. It could have been really kitsch. But it was very tastefully done.We pulled up after a long flight from the UK and the uniformed doorman in a white Pith Helmet opened the door for us, high fived the kids and gave us a friendly welcome.The checkin staff were helpful and friendly explaining everything to us and informing us of the free 6pm wine tasting in reception. Gets the evening off to a good start :-)In reception there is a small 'treasure chest' that the kids get to pick something from each day.The room was spotlessly clean and had a great view over the fishing harbour to Alcatraz and the Golden Gate bridge.Valet parking wasn't too badly priced. We certainly experienced more expensive parking on our holiday. And it's a 'per 24hr' charge so you can come and go as much as you wish at no extra charge.The cable car turnaround is right next door and the 'Big Red Shiny Mac Fireengine' of Fire Engine Tours leaves from right behind the hotel.If you are looking for a family friendly city centre hotel in a good location. I heartily recommend this hotel. I'll certaintly be staying here next time i'm in SF.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-11"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Little Spot", "text": "Stayed at the 414 Inn,Nov 10,11,12,13. I Have used tripadvisor many times to choose my hotels, and once again was pleased with my choice. The reviews were right on.This is a quiet, small hotel with great staff,and the location could not be better, so central.We were on the forth floor and as mentioned before there is no elevator,it didn't bother us but some people wouldn't like it. The rooms were large and very clean. We used the fireplace sitting/lobby area alot to have a drink together at the end of the day. Breakfast was great. My only complaint was the smell of cigarette smoke that sometimes came out of the vent in the bathroom? I just closed the bathroom door before we went to bed and the room was fine, and it certainly would not keep me from staying here again. I couldn't believe how friendly the people of NY are, and very helpful, especially in the subway, for train info. The subway is the best way to get around and it doesn't take long to figure it out. Go see the city and have a great time, we did! and we can't wait to go back.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-11-19"}

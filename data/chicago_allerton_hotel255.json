{"city": "chicago", "title": "Excellent Location great value", "text": "I booked a room 24 hours in advance on Hotwire for $90. My husband and I had wanted to stay in the Gold Coast/Mag Mile area, and this was perfect. The hotel is right in the middle of all of the shopping on N. Michigan Ave.The room was very clean, and the bed was even more comfortable than my bed at home.This is not a luxury hotel, and did not have a ton of amenities (pool, etc.), but if you're looking for a nice room, great location and great price, I strongly recommend this hotel.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-11-15"}

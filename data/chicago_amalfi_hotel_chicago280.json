{"city": "chicago", "title": "Love the Amalfi!", "text": "Had a great time at the Amalfi for a &quot;girls weekend&quot;. I saw the great ratings and review on Trip Advisor first then began to check out prices on several online booking agents. Found a good price online and then called the Amalfi directly. Not only did they match the price--they beat the price by 10%! So, we got a really good deal on the room!We had four females in one room with two double beds, so it was a little tight but that's to be expected. The room was neat and clean and loved the bathroom.Loved the breakfast on the floor so we didn't have to trek downstairs while getting ready in the morning.The location was great for our trip. Situated about half-way between the Mile and the theater district. Also, the best Thai restaurant in Chicago is right behind the Amalfi (Vongs Thai Kitchen).Had a super experience and would love to stay her again!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-08"}

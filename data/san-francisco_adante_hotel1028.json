{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "good quiet easy located hotel", "text": "excellent location, room had everything i wanted, bath/safe.except no kettle, only coffee maker, but not a big problem.room was quietly located. Initially i had booked this hotel for only 1 week, just in case i didn't like it, but because i was happy with room and location i decided to book another week and i didn't have to change room!The Bed was very comfortable and had big TV. Room generally very clean.Staff pretty good, except on two occasions i managed to change travelers cheques, on the third another receptionist said they weren't allowed to, which is strange as the other receptionist did, especially as i thought travellerscheques were widely accepted in USAThere is an internet cafe right next door, which is also connected through the hotels reception.Hotel is centrally located only about less than 10 mins walk to Powell Street Bart and cable cars. there are plenty of cafe's etc on the hotels road.Although there are a few homeless people about they really do not bother you, otherwise you can get an no.38 bus right on the road.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-13"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Amalfi: amazing exeprience", "text": "Myself and two other friends stayed at the Amalfi Hotel for the last week and August. I must say this was an excellent stay and the service was above par. I cannot rave enough about the excellence and quality this hotel boasts. The check in was quick and painless, we arrived at 10 am and were allowed to go to our room right away! There are DVD's to borrow from the lobby if you want to watch something in particular. The hotel is VERY chic and trendy. Definitely a higher end boutique hotel. The location is fantastic. Literally a 5 minute walk to State Street or Michigan Ave. The conceirge set up all of our reservations and other activities for us without question. Even got us on guest list to some of the most exclusive clubs. The reception was delightful, almost like an Italian Antipasti bar: cheese, olives, salmon, bruchetta... etc. Our room was right across and we'd literally get up from a nap get snacks and eat them in our room. Same thing for the Breakfast on each floor. Such an excellent touch. The rooms were kept immaculate, comfortable beds with high quality douvets and pillows. Some complain the room a little on the smaller size but for three girls we were extremely comfortable. I have absolutely no complaints and I would stay at this hotel most definitely next time I visit this city. OUTSTANDING!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-09-29"}

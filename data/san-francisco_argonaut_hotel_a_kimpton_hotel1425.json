{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Loved it!", "text": "This was our second stay in this hotel, as we first visited in 2007. I mentioned this and was upgraded to a room with a view, at no extra charge, a great start to the holiday! We love the location, as it is on the edge of the Fisherman's Wharf area, but not too crazy. There are plenty of places to eat nearby and a short walk from lots of major attractions.We received complimentary continental breakfast vouchers and loved the Blue Mermaid restaurant. The breakfast included pastries, toast or muffins, tea, coffee or juice and a fresh fruit salad. I usually paid $5 or $6 dollars extra, to add a cooked breakfast, which was delicious. The atmosphere, setting and service were all of a high standard.The hotel also has a complimentary drinks hour, offering wine and sparkling apple juice, as well as snacks. This was very popular, so seating was limited, but this didn't matter, as it was a lovely way to spend an hour, meeting other people, or just chilling after a busy day.We booked the hotel with Virgin holidays, so am unsure of the exact price, as it was one of 5 hotels we stayed in during our visit, however, the holiday rep told us it was cheaper than the Holiday Inn express, so maybe Virgin have a good deal with the hotel?Our room was on the top floor and was very clean and spacious. The nautical decor is very nice and the bedding of a very high quality. We experienced no problems with noise (as mentioned in some reviews)All the staff were very friendly and helpful.Would I stay here again? Absolutely!", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-24"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "More like the 'Allergy Hotel'", "text": "My wife and I read a lot of reviews before choosing the Allerton and I have to admit we were disappointed. The room was the size of a small bedroom and the breakfast was terrible (packaged eggs). The hotel was apparently under construction as they had a makeshift check-in area on the second floor. The restaurant looked mediocre (but then again, who would eat there with all the nice restaurants in Chicago) as did the bar area. Only 7 people max could fit in the elevators at one time and one of them was broken the whole time we were there. Here's a word of caution: when flushing the toilet, make sure the lid is closed as it is an industrial toilet and it sprays all over the place.You're probably wondering about the title, &quot;More like the Allergy Hotel&quot;. On the way out the door one time, I looked up at the ceiling and noticed the filter for the AC. Through the vent I could see how dirty the filter was so I decided to take a picture of it (uploaded in the gallery section). When we showed the picture to the person at the front desk he looked at it, thought about it for a few seconds and said he would call maintenance about it.The shower head was nice and so was the view of the Magnificent Mile, but not worth the $291 we paid for one night (hotel, taxes, parking, breakfast and DSL access).", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-06"}

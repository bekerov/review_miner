{"city": "chicago", "title": "Good location - bad hotel -- find another place to stay!!", "text": "We stayed there for a wedding and were not in the room for very long - thank goodness! The room was tiny and dirty - cobwebs on the walls and corners. The phone was broken - the message waiting light was on and blinked all night long because we couldn't acceess the message. We ended up disconnecting it from the wall. We ordered room service and left the room for a while...only to return and our food was gone! They came into our room and took the tray, water, food...everything was gone! The elevators are an absolute nightmare! They are tiny and run very slow. When we were leaving for the wedding the elevator was stuck on the floor we were on and didn't move so we ended up taking the stairs. The next morning we decided to stay for the breakfast buffet. The food was good...when it was out on the buffet table!! The hostess was not only sitting people, she was also responsible for bringing out the fresh food...which didn't work quite well. We had to wait forever to eat. The only good thing about this hotel was the location. I'm from Chicago and would not stay there again - there are so many other places!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-09-04"}

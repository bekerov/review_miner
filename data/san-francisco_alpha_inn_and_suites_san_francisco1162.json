{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great deal!Super location!", "text": "As a native san franciscan who lives out of town now but visits frequently,i find the alpha inn the best choice for me.It is a very convienient location right off the golden gate bridge on highwayway 101 close to downtown,the wharf,golden gate park and the beach.It has two building options,an older victorian style which i prefer especially the suites and a newer motel type w/ pool.Rooms are clean and neat.The staff are friendly and accomodating.It is steps away from several nice shopping and eating neighborhoods,( chestnut st. and union st.)and the beautiful marina and presidio.Take it from a local this is a good deal in s.f.

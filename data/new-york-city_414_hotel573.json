{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great little hotel!", "text": "The hotel is small and friendly and in a great location - only 5-10 minutes walk from Times Square and subway stations and right on top of loads of restaurants, yet far enough off the main roads to be quiet enough to get some sleep. There is no elevator, which may be a pain if you have large cases, but the friendly staff offered to help us with our bags. Our room was a good size and so was the bathroom. Everything was clean and the bed was nice and comfy. The large flat screen TV on the wall was a nice touch, and a mini fridge in the room was handy to keep cool drinks on hand. The complimentary breakfast each morning was simple, with cereal, fresh croissants and bagels etc. but all you need to start you off for the day. Overall, we were really pleased with the hotel and would definitely recommend others to give it a go if you're happy with a simple, informal base to explore New York", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-08-25"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Wonderful...Perfect Location", "text": "This was me and my husband's first time visiting New York. We were unsure of where to stay. We just knew we wanted to be close to restaurants and shopping. EVERYONE walks in New York. So put your walking shoes on. When we arrived at 60 Thompson I was extremely impressed. This boutique hotel is super sheek and elegant. The service was magnificent. The location is PERFECT. Its close to everything. When you a walk out of the hotel there are boutiques everywhere and a ton of eating places. The hotel is only a couple of blocks away from Broadway where a lot of the major clothing and shoe stores are located. We could not have a picked a more perfect hotel. There is also a roof top bar that is ultra hip and has a beautiful view of the city. When we return to New York we will certainly stay here again. Also the rooms are pretty pricey but we got a good deal by booking it on Quickbook. It cut the price of the room in half.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-18"}

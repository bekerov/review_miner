{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Horrible Dirty Hotel", "text": "We booked this hotel as it was fairly cheap and although it had some mixed reviews we thought we'd give it a try. That was a mistake! The hotel reception is nice, however when you get up to the rooms thats a different story. My bed sheets had cigarette burns, the carpets were filthy and on the last night I shared my bed with some bed bugs! The location of the hotel was good since it was near to Union Square, however if you turn right &amp; walk up the street its a pretty scary neighbour. Overall the hotel spoiled our trip to San Francisco, I'm just glad we were only there for 3 days, I couldn't have lasted any longer.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-19"}

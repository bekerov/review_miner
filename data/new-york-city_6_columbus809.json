{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great location contemporary interior design", "text": "Me and my boyfriend have stayed in a standard queen room for two nights. Rooms were well decorated in a contemporary minimalist style with great artwork on the walls. The size of the room is not big, but standard for NY. Room itself was very clean, designer toiletries in the bathroom. Pity they didn't have a trash can in the room, only in bathroom. I wish they could improve on the lighting, it was a bit dark. We found location very convenient, right next to subway and huge shopping center with Whole Foods, where we got our breakfast. There was a sushi restaurant downstairs which looked very good and very busy every night. Cabs were easy to catch right next to the hotel. Staff was very polite and helpful, as well as good looking. Overall, we enjoyed our stay.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-21"}

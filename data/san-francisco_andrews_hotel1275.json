{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Value!", "text": "I have stayed in a lot of hotels in San Francisco in different parts of the city and i would recommend the Andrews Hotel for the no frills type traveller that is more interested in seeing the sights than having a fancy room. The rooms are on the small side but are very clean. The bedding is adequate. What I like about the Andrews the most is that the price is somewhere around $139 depending on the room that you pick and it is located within walking distance to Chinatown, North Beach of even Fishermans wharf if you are in decent shape. The neighborhood that the Andrews is located in is Union Square though it is on the outermost edge. The BART station is only four blocks away. The staff has always been very friendly and helpful, taking time to draw up maps and give advice on the area. Coffee and pastries are availble right outside your door in morning. Finos italian restaurant is next door to the property and is excellent. I would recommend Andrews to anyone.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-13"}

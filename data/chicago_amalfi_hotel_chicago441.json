{"city": "chicago", "title": "super stay", "text": "I was a little intimated by the very hip check in &quot;desk&quot; and the very retro type colors of yellow and orange but once I adjusted to the lobby I absolutely loved my stay. The hotel was very, very clean and the afternoon Manager reception was quite nice with appetizers and beverages of your choice. I would definately stay at this hotel on return trips. Loved it!!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-03-11"}

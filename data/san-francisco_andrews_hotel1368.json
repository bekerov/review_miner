{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "lived up to expectations", "text": "We just spent a great weekend in SF and would like to add our recommendation of the Andrews to the many that we read before booking.This was a weekend with no kids getaway and my wife's first time in San Francisco. The Andrews website presents a very accurate description of the hotel, there were no bad surprises. We asked for and got a quiet room at the back and although the rooms and bathrooms are small they are just perfect for the amount of time we planned on spending. We bought the three day MUNI pass and were just a few blocks walk to the Cable Car or the MUNI train, or the trolley cars. The breakfast is basic but good muffins and very good strong coffee. We would highly recommend this hotel to anybody who is normally a B+B type or who just likes old quaint places to stay. Thanks", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-10-06"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Beware! Beware!", "text": "Prices of rooms are left to the disgration of the very unfriendly staff. BEWARE... of hidden charges that will later show up on your credit card bill. Parking is not included in the price and you will NOT be warned of this. When you check in you will be advised where to park and that they require an additional $50.00 deposit for the phone, TV, etc. on top of the room rate. They will never mention you must pay an additional fee of $51.00 per night for parking. After you pay cash for your room and parking charges you will see on your next credit card statement charges for the parking garage in the amount of $51.00 which they will say was a tip. When you phone in for a reservation you are required to give a credit card number to hold the room and they will charge what ever they want to it without your permissionand you never have to present the card or signing anything.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-03-19"}

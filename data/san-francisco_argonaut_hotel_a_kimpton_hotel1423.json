{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great location for sightseeing", "text": "Just far enough to be away from the noise, but within walking distance to Fishermen's Wharf and the Hyde Park Trolley. Other transportation, including cable cars, is nearby. If you are looking for a charming SF neighborhood to settle into, this area is not the spot, but if you are looking for a base for a few nights from which to see the sights it works well.The &quot;bay view&quot; room on the 3rd floor was really a view of the rooftop of the restaurant across the street, but you can see Alcatraz over the top. Although rooms on the other side of the hotel would have the advertised view (out a very small window) of the Golden Gate Bridge, I don't believe the cost is justified; especially if you have to sacrifice a King bed. The front desk reduced the rate slightly when I complained, which was a nice gesture.Rooms were comfortable, the nautical theme is cute. No noise in the hallways. I did not rate the service because we were mostly out of the hotel.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-27"}

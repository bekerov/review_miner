{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Quaint hotel near Union Square", "text": "My mother and I stayed here 5/18 - 5/22. The staff was friendly, the location was convenient to Union Square (shopping and restaurants), and the breakfast was decent (pastries, juice, coffee, fruit). The beds were comfy and there were extra pillows in the closet. Our room faced the back, so there was some noise from the restaurant &quot;Le Colonial&quot; behind the hotel, but it wasn't so bad we couldn't sleep. The slamming of our neighbors' room doors was a bit disturbing, though. There is a coffee/tea/cocoa table in the lobby at all hours, which is nice. Valet took longer than expected to bring our car around, but it didn't cause any problems since we built extra time into our schedule. The lobby is small, but has enough chairs and a couch to sit and wait for your car or rest. For the price, location, and staff demeanor, it was definitely worth it. One staff member did give us the wrong directions to the Bay to Breakers though...", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-05-30"}

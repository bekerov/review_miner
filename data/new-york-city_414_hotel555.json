{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Perfect", "text": "I stayed at the 414 over the New Year period with 4 friends. The atmosphere of this hotel is very relaxed and informal and the staff are more than willing to help, often brewing fresh coffee when we needed it, which was pretty often! You can help yourself to drinks from the small kitchen whenever you like. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and of course the location is great. Plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from if you don't want to go too far, but really close to Times Square. The actual road it's on is pretty quiet so that's a bonus. The only negative is that sometimes the water wasn't as hot as it could have been and you sometimes had to ask for the heating to be turned on - but these were not big problems. I would definitely stay there again, it made my stay very comfortable.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-01-06"}

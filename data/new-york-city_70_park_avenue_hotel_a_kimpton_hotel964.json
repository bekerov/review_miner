I have stayed in the best hotels and the worst! But this time the cold was ridiculous! For Gods Sake my cream was frozen. If thats NOT AN INDICATION that it is to cold in the bathroom then i give up. When i called the room service the service man came up to my room right away. I told him that the room service operator on the phone said, &quot;YES&quot; the radiator in the bathroom was supposed to be on. Well the service man replied to me at the door, &quot;no we dont turn on the radiator unless its really cold&quot;. Well the next morning i went into the bathroom to take a shower. It was so cold you had to wear socks. My boyfriend had never seen this before and he has lived in NYC for 20 years! My cream that was in a jar was almost frozen. Is that cold enough for you? The bedroom wasnt so bad. It was 55 degrees and we were on the 7th floor, it took 13 hours for it to go up to 73 degrees in the room.- lucky i brought my heating pad. There is something clearly wrong with the heat in this hotel! The funny part is when we left the radiator was pumping out 80 degrees heat! It was very uncomforatable. It was likea comedy show. Lucky i have a sense of humor. The room was small, the TV was located in an awkward location on the wall. The water pressure was good, the free wine was nice, the $15 credit at the mini bar was nice, the breakfeast was lame but the girl hosting (Andrea) was very sweet. The room was a nightmare and not cheap! To cold, To loud, To small! Oh and also you can hear everything next to you. I heard an entire conversation of the person in the other room! Sorry but its the truth and people have to know. Nice peopel ... too bad. Never come back.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-14"}

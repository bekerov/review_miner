{"city": "chicago", "title": "Excellent Hotel!!!", "text": "Just got back my husband and I have of an excellent stay at the Amalfi, the room is very large, I think it was the best decision we could have. The amenities are very attractive, free internet, continental breakfast just to turn on the day!, And afternoon happy hour ... with delicious snacks and drinks, you have to try &quot;Amalfitini&quot; the house specialty. The hotel is 8-10 minutes walk from the Clark station, so you do not need to take taxi to get there, there are many restaurants nearby, convenience stores, I recommend the place with the best pizza in chicago &quot;Lou Malnati's&quot; try the pizza &quot;deep dish&quot; is her specialty.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-03"}

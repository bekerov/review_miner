{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Pretty good overall", "text": "I don't have a good track record of picking hotels in New York and so when this one was recommended to me by a colleague I thought I might as well give it a shot.Overall, I was not disappointed. Arrival impression was not great because at street level is the restaurant; reception is upstairs and I was not offered assistance with my luggage. Furthermore, both receptionists were on the phone when I arrived and so I waited longer than I would like to check in - which after 8 hours travelling is not welcome.Room itself was clean and looked fairly recently updated, bed comfortable, decent bathroom. As with most NYC hotels, pretty small though.I didn't have any noise issues (another common problem in NY).Breakfast quite nice.Wall Street is about a 25min walk away.Certainly worth considering.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-12"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "A Great Hotel that stays great over time", "text": "This was our sixth stay at the Andrews and, as usual, we enjoyed ourselves immensely. We were going to San Fran for a convention and the convention hotel was twice as expensive, even at convention rates so we gladly returned to the Andrews. The staff is friendly and accommodating, the location couldn't be better, close but away from the bustle of Union Square, and the complimentary breakfast and wine are nice touches in a home away from home. We had a corner king room this time and found it comfortable enough for a four day stay. The only possible problem was the bathroom, which would have been a challenge for a professional contortionist, but there's nothing to be done about that. Overall, they do a lot with a small space and the hotel is as charming as ever. We'd recommend it highly and will defnitely be back.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-25"}

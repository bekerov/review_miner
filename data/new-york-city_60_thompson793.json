{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great location good hotel", "text": "We were very pleased with our stay although I recognise some of the criticisms people mention. The rooms are a good size I think. Very little hanging space but good drawer space. The roof bar was great in on warm June nights with views uptown and downtown. All the staff were friendly and tried to be helpful. Some were professional, some playing enthusiastically with amateur status. No restaurant - a Thai one about to open and breakfast slow and dull while we were there - but plenty of places nearby for breakfast - try the Mercer! If you want to be in SoHo, a good place to stay.

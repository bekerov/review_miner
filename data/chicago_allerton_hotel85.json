{"city": "chicago", "title": "It's all in the details...", "text": "My husband and I stayed at the Allerton for 3 nights. At first, the hotel seemed great. Fantastic location (right on the Mile), nice decor and friendly staff. The longer we were there, the more we noticed that could be improved. The room we had was very small with hardly any storage space for our clothes. Most of our stuff we had to put on the window ledges. It did have a comfortable bed which was a relief. There was a small safe on the floor of the closet which we put our passports, extra cash and jewellery. I realized on the 2nd day that the safe was not even bolted into the floor or the wall. It wasn't very heavy and I could have easily picked it up and taken it with me if I was a thief robbing the room. Great security...it's like having cameras that don't record anything! Why bother?!?We would also strongly recommend to out of town guests, not to bother renting a car if you are staying here. The parking fee is over $50 per night and it can take up to a 1/2 hour to get your car from the valet. There is no self-park option, so you not only have to pay the large fee, but you feel obligated to tip the man who brings you your car since it's not his fault the fee is so high.All in all, we would definately not stay here again. For the extra money we spent on parking, we could have stayed at a much nicer hotel.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-29"}

The manger (Ms. Alkarimi) was very professional and made me feel at home from the first moment I walked though the door. Upon waking up and walking through the reception area to see everybody eating breakfast, it felt like one family.. a room full of strangers that seem to bond at breakfast given the comfortable layout of the room and facilities!

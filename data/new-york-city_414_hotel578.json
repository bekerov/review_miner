{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "We'll All Miss Mike", "text": "I stayed at 414 in December 2005 and January 2006, and loved this darling little hotel, not least of all because of Mike and his caring attitude, NY know-how, and great service. Mike extended himself so beautifully for the hotel guests, and did so much to enhance my visit. For instance, in January my plane got in late to JFK and the freezing rain was slowing the train into the city. I had an 8:00 curtain to see my dear mother's friend in her closing theater performance. I called Mike from the depot, and he arranged a car to pick me up just in time to get to the theatre. At the Champagne reception for the closing show, the stage director gave me a set piece (&quot;painting&quot;) to take home, and Mike helped me find a place close by to wrap it carefully and mail it home. Mike helped me find good restaurants and gave me directions to so many places. One late night I came back to the hotel and Mike was there looking very sad. He'd had news that his father was very ill. I talked and prayed with him and he shared his stories with me. I was so saddened to hear recently that Mike passed away in May of this year. I know that many of your patrons will find this a great loss, but I know that Jorje and the rest will keep up his great tradition of service. Next time I stay at 414, I hope to see a photo orsomething of him in the lobby or above the desk. In fact, I'd like to contribute to a plaque in his honor.Thanks, 414, for having Mike at your hotel. Be blessed.Sincerely,Dorothy W.Alabama", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-17"}

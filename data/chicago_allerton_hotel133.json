{"city": "chicago", "title": "Allerton is only OK", "text": "The Allerton is an OK hotel. My company paid for it, but if it were up to me, I would have booked somewhere else. Pros: Great location, central to great shopping, restaurants, etc. The ballrooms are very nice with great views of the city.Cons: The rooms are tiny, I mean tiny. My room was the smallest room I have ever stayed in. It was smaller than my bedroom at home. The halls are narrow and the elevators are tiny. They also take about 2-3 minutes to wait on one. The entry to the hotel has almost a basement feel. You have to take an elevator to the 2nd floor to check in. then a different set of elevators to the room. That means, when you leave from your room, you have to take 2 sets of elevators to get to the street. the bellmen were not friendly and the staff were OK at best. The food sucks too.I would not stay at the Allerton again. Since it was free, I can't complain too much, had i paid for it, I would be very upset.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-01"}

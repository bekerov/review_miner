To sum up our stay:Good - location, price (got a great package deal from Orbitz), and cleanliness.Bad - room size is small but sufficient (mind you, we apparently got upgraded to a Queen bed but I am not convinced since my double bed at home is the same size as their queen size) and no coffee maker in our room so we went to the lobby and asked where we can get coffee and they directed us to the lobby bar where they charged us about $5 for a cup...now that's a bit ridiculous considering Starbucks was located across the street.Would I return again? Yes - only if I can get the same deal. I'll just have to remember not to ask for coffee the next time around! = )", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-20"}

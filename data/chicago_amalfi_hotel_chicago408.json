{"city": "chicago", "title": "A Hip Place in the Loop", "text": "I spent a weekend at the Amalfi after finding other boutique hotels booked up. It was a pleasant surprise. While the block the hotel is on is somewhat grubby, it was safe and well-located for walking in the Loop. The hotel is only six stories high and has no restaurant or bar, but every evening there is a &quot;happy hour&quot; with free cocktails and heavy hors d'oeuvres in a sixth-floor gathering room that really turns into a party. There were guests of all ages, including families with young children, and everyone was having a good time. Based on reviews I had read here, I made sure the bartender saw me put a tip in his jar, but he really didn't appear to care one way or another -- he was extremely pleasant to everyone despite the crowds of thirsty guests. There is also an ample continental breakfast set up in each floor's elevator lobby every morning.My room was very comfortable and attractively decorated in a modern style with deep jewel tones and nice fabrics. I was very satisfied with the Amalfi, and would return.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-11-13"}

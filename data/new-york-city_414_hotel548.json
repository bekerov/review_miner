Very nice design and for me i found the room to be spacious compared to other new york hotels for the same price and location. i'll be booking my trip next year soon and will be staying again,loved the location and found the staff to be more friendly than any big chain. maybe this is recent but when i got back after a day out I was greeted by a complimentary glass of wine in the cosy lobby-nice touch! Spoke with memebers of staff who said they are about to redesign the lobby to give a more lounge feel - should be nice.this is not a gripe but I would like to have a more healthy/muesli/granola cereal choice for breakfast", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-03-31"}

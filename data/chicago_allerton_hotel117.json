{"city": "chicago", "title": "Fantastic", "text": "Just returned from 7 day stay = FANTASTIC (for a frame of reference-I'm particular about, well, everything). Stayed 14th flr in King Jr. Suite (350 sq ft.). Separate bedrm &amp; sitting rm, TVs in both, sofa in sitting rm is sofa bed, plenty of closet/drawer space, decent size bathrm, lg shower, lg desk w/ comfortable chair. Good space for a couple (were comfortable, spent 1 whole very rainy day in rm relaxing). Excellent location, very courteous staff, nice view from windows (think true for majority of building), good water pressure, unlimited hot water, good sound proofing (not once did hear others in adjacent rms), carpet/linens/decorating all fresh &amp; seem recently updated, clean all around hotel, in-rm housekeeping great, located on top flr is adequate gym w/ good equipment (check out view). Our only problem = in-rm safe was not attached to anything, could walk away w/ whole thing. Regarding elevator complaints made by others - we only found them slow during check in/out times. Would prefer in-rm mini-frig, but knew when booked there wasn't one. Price - could spend less or more in area, you'll get what you pay for. Best meal of whole trip - BIJAN cafe a few blocks away - weekend brunch has French toast that we'd travel from FL to IL again for!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-01"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Location In Midtown Manhattan", "text": "We spent three nights at the 414 Hotel while enjoying NYC during the Christmas holidays and it was a great place to stay.The location can't be beat for the price. It is a few short blocks to Times Square and a few more from that to Rockefeller Center. There is a subway stop a few blocks away as well. The best part of the location is that the hotel is located right on Restaurant Row so there are dozens of restaurants literally at your doorstep.This boutique hotel had a lot more to offer than the expensive chain hotels you find in every major city. They served a nice breakfast each morning that consisted of fresh croissants, muffins, and juices. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They suggested restaurants and helped us schedule a car to the airport for a great price.The rooms are small but most NYC hotel rooms are. We had seen complaints on TripAdvisor about the noise levels and didn't find any problem with noise while we were there even though the hotel was full.Overall, we would stay here again. The location, price, and comfort definitely added to the enjoyment of our stay in NYC.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-12-08"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Cute hotel! would stay here again.", "text": "I wasn't expecting this hotel to be great as it is rated 1 star but I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel had a warm cozy feeling to it throughout our whole stay.My friend and I didn't have a great arrival to San francisco as we had travelled from LA to this hotel on coach for over 8 hours so it was late at night when we checked in. Upon arrival the first thing you will notice about San francisco is the amount of homeless people on the street. Anyway when we arrived at the hotel the staff were friendly with check in and the room we were given was so cute. it was clean and well equipped with TV, coffee maker and essentials.Through out our whole stay we had no problems with the hotel, and if you ever find your way to San Francisco then I would suggest you stay here. You will not regret it! It is also in a great location...5 mins away from the main shopping center and easily accessable to any other popular attraction!There is a cool little cafe across the street owned by a Chinese couple who serve great food! I recommend you visit them and give it a try. Also one particular staff member who is friendly and helpful is Mart so seek him out.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-06"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great location clean and cheap!", "text": "We got a great deal for this hotel through Expedia and as we only planned to use it as somewhere to sleep, a luxury hotel wasn't high on our list of priorities. The rooms were clean, if a little dated. Bed was comfortable with clean sheets, blankets etc. All the basic facilities were there (TV, coffee maker, iron etc). Bathroom was spotless and room was cleaned every day.The free breakfast was toast, muffins, coffee &amp; juice- but if you want something more substantial there are plenty of reasonably priced places nearby.Overall a great hotel with a brilliant location- i'm sure it's very hard to beat for the price.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-22"}

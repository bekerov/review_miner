{"city": "chicago", "title": "Nice centrally located choice on the Mag Mile", "text": "Was spending the night after a jazz concert with my girlfriend and decided to buy through hotwire. The hotel is doing some remodeling, so some aspects of getting around were awkward. The elevators from the lobby level up are very small, but this is a 1920s building!We were actually given a 2-room suite that was very tastefully decorated, with a great view. Large living area with nice furniture. Flat-panel tv in the bedroom, and a large bathroom. Of course parking is supremely expensive with the affiliated garage, but I got the room for about $100. Well worth it, and a great historic building. If you get a price in the $100-125 range, I think it's worth it.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-03-27"}

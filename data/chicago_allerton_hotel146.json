{"city": "chicago", "title": "Decor little to be desired", "text": "Stayed in a double room for my daughters' wedding. Very small . Curtains and carpeting stained. The rest of our guests stayed at the Sofitel for the same price, but what a difference. We were comped overnight parking for one night but not the second even though we were led to believe we were. Great location but the rooms really need some updating. We were on the 16th floor and had to wait at least 10 to 15 minutes for an elevator that was empty. Next time it's the Sofitel for us.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-11-25"}

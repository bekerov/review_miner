{"city": "chicago", "title": "The elevators are not the only things that needs to be updated!", "text": "They appear to be throwing out the old beds, wallcoverings and desks. They should continue with the management! The official hotel website did not indicate the hotel was under construction. The rooms have been updated, but do not include irons, coffee maker, mini-bar or buckets to acquire ice. When I addressed several of my concerns, particularly around requesting ice, 3 times, the management was only interested in getting me off the phone. Trying to reach management via phone took me 30 minutes and 4 attempts. The fitness room is currently not operational, although, ask any staff member and they will tell you otherwise. I tried to dine in the restaurant, but they did not offer dinner after 9 pm. When I informed them that it was 8:50, they did take my order, but they reported being out of two types of beer and three types of entrees.I ended up going elsewhere to eat. Be prepared to come to this hotel with plenty of patience and expectations low.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-23"}

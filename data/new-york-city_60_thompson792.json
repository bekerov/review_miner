{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great location A+ service!", "text": "After doing a fair bit of research, a friend and I selected 60 Thompson as our hotel of choice for a long weekend of shopping in NYC. We couldn't have selected a better hotel. We requested a room on high floor, and we were given a clean, quiet, spacious (by NYC standards) room with a great view. Our room fit 2 double beds easily, with ample space to get around without bumping into each other. We had absolutely no noise problems; I slept like a baby! I loved the turn-down service, complete with brownies, and the yummy bath products.Our every request was promptly answered, if not already thoughtfully provided for in advance. The beds did not have top-sheets - we requested top sheets, which were brought to us in less than 10 minutes by the courteous housekeeping staff, at 11 p.m. at night! We had a bit of a wait (40 minutes)for our room to be prepared when we were checking in, but the hotel offered us free drinks on the house, and held our luggage while we got an early start on our shopping. The rooftop bar and hotel lobby lounge were chic spots to get a drink after a long day of shopping, without being intrusive, noisy or overcrowded, like the &quot;social scene&quot; at some other hip NYC hotels.I can't say enough good things about this hotel. Finding a hotel that provides a great ambiance and good service is always a bit of a gamble in NYC, and this one paid off. I will definitely return to 60 Thompson on my next visit to NYC, and would readily recommend it to anyone looking for a gem of a hotel in the Soho/Greenwich village area.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-06-22"}

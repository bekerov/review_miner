{"city": "chicago", "title": "The Amalfi was wonderful", "text": "I really enjoyed staying at the Amalfi. The decor is beautifully done and brought back wonderful memories of my travels to the Amalfi coast and Capri. The breakfast was great. You could get a plate full of food and coffee and take it back to your room. The location is nice for shopping on the Magnificent Mile or going to the park. I found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-22"}

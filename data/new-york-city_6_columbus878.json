{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Stay now before everyone else finds out about it!", "text": "I stayed here this past Friday night, and was thoroughly impressed. For this price point, 6 Columbus is a great, hip choice. It has a kickass location (just behind Columbus Circle), which makes it very convenient. There aren't a lot of large-hotel amenities (such as pool or business centre), but it's high on design (blue/silver/brown trendy decor) and nice boutiquey touches such as Fresh brand toiletries. The staff is friendly, and the hotel small enough that you can get in and get out without long waits for anything. It's not for everyone, but if you like hip boutique hotels, you should definitely stay at 6 Columbus now...before all the rooms get trashed by overuse.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-27"}

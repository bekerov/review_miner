{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Good choice for Murray Hill/Grand Central area", "text": "Hotel was well located and close to Grand Central -- the room was on a &quot;non-view&quot; side but was decent sized (as everyone else has said) for NYC, about 3 feet around the bed, which is okay. The mini-bar was well stocked and we did not hear any noise from the other rooms. Nice desk and fixtures in the room itself. The bathroom was not the greatest and the shower had low pressure, but the bed was extremely comfortable. Staffing was strange - it seemed like there were only 2 people who worked there - the bell captain and the reception desk person, and they had a hard time handling the 4 people in the lobby when we got there - not sure if this was because it was a Sunday.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-19"}

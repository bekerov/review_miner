{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "A dump but a very nice clean dump.", "text": "As I told the cabbie taking me back to the hotel... (Try getting a cab in SF at 3:30 AM on New Years morning, but that's another story.) Where are you going to get a hotel in SF on New Years Eve for $50?? I only live 100 miles away, so I visit the city from time to time. I had passed by the Aida before, so I had stopped to take a look. Very old, (Probably built in the 20's), but very clean. So, since I was going to the city for NY Eve, I decided to stay there. VERY basic hotel. For an additional $10, you can get a room with bathroom facilities, but I decided to go with the most basic. Both bathroom and shower room were just a few steps down the hall. Both were also very clean. Room was also very basic, with an old TV with a channel DIAL, an old radio that didn't seem to work, a dresser, sink, and medicine cabinet with plastic cups inside. Towels and soap were also provided. The bed was a newer bed, and VERY comfortable, and sleeps two. Mine had only one pillow, so I told the clerk, and he immediately got me another pillow. I slept very comfortably. I didn't take advantage of the &quot;continental breakfast.&quot; (Coffee and donuts.) The biggest drawback to the hotel is the location at 7th and Market near the Civic Center, which is not the best of neighborhoods. However, the hotel is only a half block from the nearest bart/muni station which will take you anywhere in the city, bay area, or to either SF or Oakland airports. I was only about 5 blocks from my hotel when trying to catch a cab, but I didn't want to walk 5 blocks down Market street at 3:30 in the morning, ESPECIALLY on New Years morning. Great hotel for those on a budget who don't want to &quot;Hostel it.&quot; Proximity to Mass Transit is great.", "hotel": "aida_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-01-03"}

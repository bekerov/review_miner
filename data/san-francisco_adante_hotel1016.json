{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "A fair deal", "text": "For $50 a day in San Francisco, it's not bad. The place was clean. Do yourself a favor though: Ask for a high-floor room that faces the street. We were put in a room in the back, and the building right across (less than 15 feet) had jackasses that were partying all night. The people at the hotel though were very kind in moving us to another room. Also, on my first night there, the heat didn't work. Luckily it was a mild summer night, so it didn't matter too much, and again the people solved the problem and the next night the old-fashioned steam radiator was working. It's walking distance from a lot of cool San Francisco, so if you're just looking for a cool getaway, you should stay here.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-27"}

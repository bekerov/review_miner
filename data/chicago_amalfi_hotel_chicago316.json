{"city": "chicago", "title": "Good location clean rooms and value for money", "text": "Small boutique hotel, modern. Good location, and great deal booked through Expedia. Clean new rooms and bathrooms with modern fittings. Comfortable beds. Small closet space. On one occasion, toilet overflowed, and took several hours to finally fix it (required a few phone calls down to reception). Excellent complimentary continental breakfast on every floor (takeaway baskets to take back to your room)- make sure you get there early to get a bigger selection. Used gym once- good new facilities, considering it is a small hotel. Free Internet was great- two computers in a small room (?business centre) on top floors.

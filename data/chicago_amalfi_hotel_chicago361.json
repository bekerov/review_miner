{"city": "chicago", "title": "Amalfi was great!", "text": "My sister and I found this hotel through reviews right here on TripAdvisor. We could not believe how nice the hotel was and the amenities that were included in the price. Our visit to the beautiful city of Chicago was for leisure and this hotel contributed to a most fabulous weekend.Rooms were VERY clean. Bed comfortable. Huge bathroom with a double shower head that was heavenly. Hallways were clean and well kept. No stinky or stuffy smells. Our towels were nice and soft.Morning breakfast was a delightful spread of yogurt, fruits, muffins, breads, delicious coffees and tea. Each floor had their own set up so it was very convenient to slip out to get your morning caffeine fix.The managers reception, which is located on the 6th floor, was unbelievable. Name brand liquor, such as Kettle One vodka, Skyy vodka and Captain Morgan, were the options available for our nightly cocktails. In addition, wine and beer are also available. An elegant spread of meats, cheeses, and breads were laid out for our snacking pleasure. The lobby was small, but very clean and decorated nicely. The front end people were polite. Many times you get overly eager doorman so, in my opinion, these gentleman did an exceptional job.We found a very good rate for this hotel. The atmosphere and cleanliness, along with the amenities, made this an exceptional value in a city were hotel rooms run extremely high.Thank you Hotel Amalfi! We will refer your establishment to friends, family and even strangers!!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-17"}

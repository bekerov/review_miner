{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "6 Columbus a winner (for the right price)", "text": "My wife and I stayed at 6 Columbus for a Sat night in March 2008. The hotel looks like its brand new. Its a smaller building on 58th and 8th Ave, but right off of the famous Columbus circle and on the corner of Central Park so the location is quite central to midtown and upper west side. The stylings are quite modern and the staff were very attentive. We were upgraded from a pod room to a queen size bed for free which was great. That said, the hotel is a very small building, and the rooms are a little smaller than average, but two people don't really need more space than that. What matters is that the hotel is clean and brand spanking new. I would definitely recommend this hotel to couples with no children, but probably ONLY at the right price. I've heard the hotel rates average around $300 and up, but I got a greal deal on perfectescapes.com for $145 for a pod room. These may not last long as the hotel gains more and more popularity.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-03-17"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Loved it!", "text": "Just recently returned from Chicago to attend a friend's wedding. In searching for a place to stay, I found a great deal on expedia.com for $89.00/night I couldn't pass up. I booked the Allerton on the spot then started reading past reviews on this forum. I became very skeptical about my choice based on everyone's complaints on the size of the rooms, elevators, service, etc. But based on the price, I figured how bad could it really be?Boy was I pleasantly surprised! The hotel is in an awesome location. The entrance is on Huron Street but N. Michigan is just to the right. We stayed in the standard room. A bit small but perfect for two.. no more! Loved the Bath N Body products! We had a view of N.Michigan Ave. I could see the Zara store just outside my window. They were having their grand opening that night, red carpet laid out and the whole nine yards! Everything is in walking distance, to the right about two blocks is the Hancock Observatory, the Navy Pier is probably about a ten minute walk to the left. So many shops in between to window shop. The red line CTA station was also just a short walk away!Yes the elevators are very small, occasionally had to wait awhile for one, but figured I'm on vacation, what's the rush anyway?! Didn't eat in the restaurant, prices are steep esp. for a cup of coffee. But complimentary coffee is available in the lobby every morning. There are also tons of restaurants nearby, we ate at Giordano's on Rush St., just two blocks away, Great stuffed pizza! Also in the evening, carriage rides are available just outside the main entrance of the hotel.Service was wonderful, we had a problem with the safe in the closet, but help was on the way in less than five minutes.Overall, our experience at the Allerton was wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone visiting the Windy City!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-08"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Rooms and Gym; Staff and service questionable", "text": "Staying at the Amalfi is the tale of two halves. The hotel as a facility is very nice with quiet rooms, comfortable beds and a nice gym.However, the breakfast was mediocre at best (stale coffee and bread) and traveling up a floor for a toaster is senseless (they had to buy a lot of equipment so why not a toaster for each floor). It appears that the staff cut backs (assumed) have started to take its toll on the hotel's overall quality.The final straw was when I called to ask for a late check-out and was told that the cleaning staff had said that no more late check-outs were allowed for today. Enjoy the room but don't bank on the little extras (like you read elsewhere for this review) until the economy picks up.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-21"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Hotel - Perfect Location", "text": "We absolutely loved staying the the Argonaut Hotel, it's right on fishermans wharf and walking distance to everywhere that side of town. The cable car is in the park right next door and all the tourist busses leave from the street the other side. The hotel staff were really friendly and allowed us to print our Alcatraz booking confirmation that we'd forgot to bring. The wifi in the rooms was free if you sign up to their newsletter which was very useful for my iPhone and checking the exchange rate!When we come back to San Fran we will definately be staying here again.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-29"}

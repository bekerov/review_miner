{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Very nice stay here", "text": "We just spent 3 days in SF and at the Argonaut. The front desk was very helpful and let us check in 6 hours early when we arrived and even upgraded our room.The nautical, yet modern theme of the hotel is very nice and the room was clean and roomy. The noise from the streets was a bit noisy at times but the sound of the famous cable cars was kind of fun to hear from our room. For some reason neither one of us could comfortable in our beds though. Not sure if it was us or the mattresses though.The staff at the restaurant was nothing short of amazing! Friendly, smiling and always willing to strike up a conversation. The location of hotel is a bit touristy but close to almost every great neighborhood, either by foot, bus or cable car. Thanks Argonaut!", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-04"}

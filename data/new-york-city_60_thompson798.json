{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Beautiful! Can't wait to stay again.", "text": "This is THE hotel for all you fabulously modern hip people. You can easily pass by the building it self because the exterior is quite serene and not as flashy as other boutique hotels. The bottom floor is the concierge, plush wall seating and elevators. The main &quot;lobby&quot; is on the second floor, where the registration desk and the Thom Bar are situated. Down to their Nino Cerruti uniforms, 60 Thompson was stylish and oh so pleasing to the eye. The people in the front desks looked like they were from the Elite and Ford Model Agencies. YUMMMYYY! Once you get up to the room, it's designed for the Architectural Digest crowd: Frette linens, huge suede headboard, 2 dark mahogany sidetables, toiletries from Fresh that included the best smelling Soy Shampoo, Pomegranate Conditioner, Lychee lotion. They even provide you with the 1 thing I ALWAYS forget to pack: Q-Tips! Something as trivial as that made me a fan of the hotel. The bathrooms were chocolate-colored marble up and down, east to west. The 2 shower heads were quite refreshing. The robes were very comfortable. The DVD player, nighttime brownie, and the friendliness of the staff, as well as everything I mentioned made 60 Thompson one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-03-12"}

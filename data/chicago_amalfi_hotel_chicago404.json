{"city": "chicago", "title": "Amalfi is first-class and comfortable!", "text": "I was told the Amalfi was the most unique boutique hotel in the city - and it is. Just got home and can't wait to go back! The residential look and feel begins at the front door and carries through the entire experience. Soft colors and luxury linens, extra bathroom features like a lighted mirror and vanity stool, multi-head shower, arched shower rod, etc. Great pillows and a robe you don't want to take off. Lots of in-room extras make you feel 'spoiled.' The manager's reception is not only incredible because the food is outstanding and premium bar is complimentary, but it offered a unique opportunity to network with staff and other guests. &quot;We love to store luggage!&quot; was the glowing response from Melissa when we asked to store bags between check out and our train departing. Walked to Michigan and State shopping areas within minutes. Definitely the right choice for a central location with exceptional service.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-11"}

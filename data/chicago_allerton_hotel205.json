{"city": "chicago", "title": "Disappointed", "text": "My husband &amp; I stayed here while I was in town for a conference. The only reason I didn't leave after checking is was b/c the stay was prepaid by my office. The front desk woman, I believe Khyla, told me the room wasn't paid for &amp; didn't try to look for the notation that said otherwise. I had to call my office, &amp; the booking company to get it sorted out. Aparently the note was on the computer had she justed scrolled down instead of telling me I was wrong. The corner room was tiny! I am a small person and had to angle by the foot of the bed to get between it &amp; the radiator. The windows didn't function, neither opening nor able to shut all the way. Therefore the cold air and traffic noises from Michigan avenue were quite loud. The toilet was stuck, flushing for five minutes each time it was used. The front desk sent up the &quot;engineer&quot; and afterwards, the toilet flushed for only a minute each time. The room appeared very worn with noticeable stains on the capet, chips in the wall paint, and sadly, the curtains didn't close, which would have been nice to block out light. The one thing the hotel had going for it were the concierge, 2 extremely helpful and nice people with great advice.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-09-28"}

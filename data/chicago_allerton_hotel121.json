{"city": "chicago", "title": "Ok for a short stay", "text": "I booked my room through the hotel website and received the &quot;special web rate&quot;, which was 15% off. It was a better rate than I could find on any other hotel website. The location is excellent and in a GREAT part of town. I was there only one night, and literally only in the room awake for 1 hour. The room was TINY!! I do not know how more than one person can stay in the &quot;petite suite&quot;. I guess that's why they call it petite. The elevators were a little slow, but nothing to really complain about. Check in was a breeze and the concierge had great suggestions for dinner. I, as a single woman, walked from the Chicago street Red line train stop back to the hotel at 11:00 PM and felt completely safe. There were still hundreds of people on the street. In all, this is a good place to stay as long as you don't plan on staying in the room too long. It's just too small. The bathroom was also tiny. Everything was clean, though and the bed was really comfortable. For the price, it was worth it compared to the prices of the other hotels on or near the Magnificent Mile.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-12"}

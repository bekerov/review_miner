{"city": "chicago", "title": "The most unpleasant hotel ever", "text": "The price was too good to be true. Truth came out as soon as we stepped in this place.First of all,George,the rude guy at the front desk took an incredible long time to check us in. We liked that,after 5 hours flight from the west coast it has been a nice Chicago welcome,thank you Mr George.The lobby was really weird,with a mixed array of colors,like orange,green,yellow..it felt like a Brasilian hotel. The only nice person seemed the bellman.Rooms. We booked a non smoking room,but it seemed the room had 20 heavy smokers in there for 2 days and never had a window open for vent. Even the sheets stinked smoke...disgusting.The mustard colored carpet was pretty worn and cigarette butt burned. A nice touch were the books and the room size,but it all appalled compared to the general feel of the room. And here we go again those weird colors.The bed was very comfy,except for the conforter wich was made with a very cheap material that turned the bed into a hoven.Maid service was really weird. They left every single day some water filled in the bathroom sink..what for ??? Weird.And turndown service was only for one night....no need that...just skip it,don't do it for just one night....The bathroom colors all added a feeling of dirty and worn,they need to replace those red/grey/yellow thing with a more traditional black/white/grey.The breakfast on each floor was not bad,really.Bottom line,if you look for a cheap place to stay then go for it ,but do not belive their overhyped self written reviews ( yes,they write their on reviews on Tripadvisor..and they know it )It was cheap tho because of the low season. I really doubt seeing myself paying more than what'ive paid ( $ 129.00 per night ) for this joke.And also go for it if you don't mind being trated like you are not cool or not hip or not whatever they stand for....", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-19"}

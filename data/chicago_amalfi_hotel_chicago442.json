{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Getaway", "text": "We had a wonderful stay at the Amalfi. Booking on line was easy, and the staff quickly responded to emails I sent. Following the advice of other TA members, I requested a front facing room on a higher floor, adding that the reason I was requesting such a room was to enjoy a romantic getaway with my wife. Check in was cordial and laid back, and the staff was very helpful. Our room was on the 6th floor and was plenty spacious for us, with a large comfy bed, 2 phones, a selection of books and cds, and a dual head shower. The water works in the bathroom were perfect - instant hot water both in the sink and the shower. The breakfast was better than most continental breakfasts, with a decent tea selection, regular and decaf coffee, yogurt (which disappeared quickly), fresh fruit, mini bagels, croissants, breads, etc.An unexpected surprise was waiting for us after we returned to our room from a night on the town. Turndown service for us included not only chocolates on the pillows, but also a bottle of chilled champagne, 2 glasses and a box of wine truffles. Also included was a card wishing us an enjoyable stay. This was completely unexpected and shows that they pay more than the usual attention to their guests. When I requested my room I was not fishing for extras, but it is nice to know that some hotels are willing to go the extra mile. We would definitely stay here again.Also, following the advice from the forums, we parked 2 blocks away at the Sterling Self Park and spent only $16/day for weekend parking as apposed to $37/day at the hotel. The self park has a special - if you park after 3pm on weekends it's only $6 for 24hrs.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-03-06"}

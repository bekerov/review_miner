{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Terrific stay at 6 Columbus", "text": "My friend and I got an amazing rate at 6 Columbus through Quikbook for January 9-12 ($127 for Fri-Sat, $90 for Sunday). We had an excellent stay from the moment we walked through the doors and the very friendly doorman took our bags and welcomed us. All the staff were kind and helpful, providing excellent service.Without asking, our room was upgraded free of charge to a queen deluxe with two beds, which was perfect. The room was spotless, and housekeeping brought us a second robe and non-feather pillows for my friend, who is allergic. The bed platforms are a bit of a nuisance, but not a big deal. Our biggest complaint was probably that the ice bucket, while very stylish, was quite shallow and not really functional. Clearly I'm really nitpicking here!I've seen comments complaining about the loud heating/air system, and it is indeed loud. However, if you're like me and my friend and you need white noise to sleep, it's perfect. The beds are also very, very comfortable and we both slept like babies.The hotel location is perfect. Right by the subway, a Subway sandwich shop, Starbucks, and a Whole Foods in the Time Warner Center across the street. Easy walk to Central Park and the theatre district, and when we were in a rush to make a show, the cab down cost $4 and took five minutes. While I wouldn't want to spend $500+ a night at 6 Columbus (or anywhere, for that matter), I definitely recommend the hotel. We had a great stay, and even received a hug from the doorman when we left. It was a terrific weekend.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-14"}

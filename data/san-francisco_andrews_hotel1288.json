{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Solid San Francisco Hotel!", "text": "We spent three nights here - Room 409 was very quiet.. It was everything advertised - great location (near Union Square) and very friendly staff. Continental breakfast was excellent - we stored the fresh fruit for our lunches and the pastries/rolls/croissants hit the spot.We traveled w/ our 11 yr. old son and for $10 each night they provided a rollaway bed.We enjoyed the complimentary wine and dined one night at FINO which has a very reasonably priced menu w/ tasty food.You are not far from a cable car line (Powell and Post) and if you are spending a few days there I recommend the MUNI passport that you can buy at the Powell and Market station as each cable car ride is $5 a throw!", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-19"}

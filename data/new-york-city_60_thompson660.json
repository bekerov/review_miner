{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Hotel and Immpecable service", "text": "We stayed during the third week in August and had an amazing time. The hotel is located in the middle of Soho which is perfect for shopping and dining. The rooms were nice sized and very clean. The hotel is getting a little dated in the rooms but it does not detract from the stay. What impressed me most was the service and friendlessness of the entire staff from the front desk, to bellman, cleaning staff, etc. Everyone was helpful and accomondating and made us feel like we were family which in todays travel is not found frequently. We will be back for sure!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-12"}

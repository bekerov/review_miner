{"city": "chicago", "title": "Small Potatoes", "text": "We paid quite a bit of money for this hotel. I have to say the reviews were right on and had we known what hotel we would get we may have just paid regular price to stay someplace else. The hotel itself was clean and the staff was nice but the rooms were tinier than my closet. We had a full size bed and that is about all that was in the room. We had to rearrange the desk and other tables so we could move around. There was no chair or place to sit and the bathroom was tiny as well. Plus, you had to enter on the ground floor, go up to 3 and catch a second elavator to your room floors. The elavators were really slow and once we waited 20 minutes to get up. We also waited 1 hour for our bags to get to our room from the bell hop. Overall, I wouldn't stay here again.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-04-24"}

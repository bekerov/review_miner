{"city": "chicago", "title": "MUCH better options in Chicago", "text": "I was really disappointed with the Allerton for the price of the room. The room was VERY small and I could hear everything through the walls. The decor was outdated and the elevator system was a mess. Some elevators didn't go to certain floors and some weren't even working. It took me on average 5-7 minutes to get to the lobby from the 11th Floor. The final thing that really bummed me out was I ordered room service and because of the room size, there was no table or desk to eat at...and they didn't bring anything to make up for that - no tray table, nothing. So I found myself eating breakfast on the floor, which I think is pretty unacceptable for a room that costs over $300 a night. The best thing was the location, it really is smack in the middle of the shopping action, but there are so many other hotels in the area and I will definitely price out other options next time around.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-21"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "EXCELLENT HOTEL NICELY SITUATED", "text": "The hotel is situated at the quieter part of the wharf. The staff were excellent, we used room service twice. Both times the service was prompt and the food was good. Our room was very nice we had twin beds which were a good size. The restaurant at the hotel is as good as any on the wharf. Jack's bar is next door if you are looking for something livelier. We found the wharf area very touristy so the hotel and the area immediately around it was a godsend. The hotel is located alongside the trolley turnaround although if you want to explore the city use the public transport it is a lot cheaper.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-19"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Value at the Andrews", "text": "We stayed at the Andrew for 4 nights 06/04/05- 06/08/05. We stayed in room #603. We were pleased with our room and found the hotel staff to be quite helpful. Our room was a corner king and although it was much smaller than most hotel rooms we have stayed in we found it to have lots of little extras. The bed had a warm down comforter. The room had a mini fridge stocked with complimentary sodas and bottled water. The bath products were Neutrogena and Bath &amp; Body works. The continental breakfast was very good and the fresh squeezed orange juice was a nice surprise. The Andrews was located within walking distance of Union Square, China Town, cable cars, and a bart station. We booked directly through the hotel and got a great rate. Our bill for 4 nights including taxes only came to $460.00. The only negative things I can say about the hotel is that the bathroom is extremely small and the city noise can be hard to sleep through especially the early morning garbage truck.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-06-16"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Slum", "text": "Not only are the rooms jacked up but the Manager of the Building is total lacking customer service skills and has no respect for heterosexual people obviously. I had never met this guy before and told him about my shower not working in my room in which I paid for a private room with shower and he acted like a kid, stating &quot;you can leave when your rent is up&quot;. My rent is up on Tuesday, at noon, and I definitely would be out of the building. If Abbott wants its hotel to improve, it first must rid of the manager. And the next time a paying customer states they shower is not working the Manager should just say I will have maintenance take a look at the situation and we will have an answer for you when you get back. Belmont is a historical place and ABBOTT HOTEL must shape itself around the Beauty Belmont holds instead of having a Bum Manager run and ruin ABBOTTS Hotel. GET RID OF THE MANAGER! Once you do that, I think the place will get better ratings.", "hotel": "abbott_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-21"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Location!", "text": "My husband and I recently stayed at The Allerton for two nights. The location of this hotel is prime for shopping at The Magnificent Mile, and very close to public transportation. We were never more than a few blocks away for anything we needed!The hotel is a landmark, and the rooms are very small. Our standard room was below average in size, and the bed was situated only a few feet from the doorway. It was fine for us, but definitely a little cramped.Had no problems with customer service, infact all those we came in contact with were very friendly and knowledgable.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-01-23"}

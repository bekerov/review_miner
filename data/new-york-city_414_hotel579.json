Choose the hotel due to the excellent reviews given on trip advisor. I was not disappointed! Hotel clean, staff friendly (especially Jessica), nice breakfast and most importantly Fab location! Would not hesitate in returning there. The bedroom overlooked the courtyard and was peaceful at night. On a sad note, after reading all the positive reviews on Mike it was sad to hear he had passed away.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-15"}

Felt safe - just have to be aware of surroundings. Rooms - Small but clean. Free Internet in the rooms and free wireless internet in the lobby cafe was a plus!Price - For $55/night, it was a great deal.Atmosphere - I agree with the reviewer who said it was &quot;studenty&quot; although I did see some families there as well.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-01-25"}

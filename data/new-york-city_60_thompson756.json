{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Outstanding!!", "text": "My wife and i recently stayed at the property(albeit one night). It was recommended by a friend and we were glad we did. From the time of our EARLY check-in on a Saturday during a busy weekend in late November to the time of checkout, everything was wonderful. I found the staff to be over-the-top nice, and considering my MANY trips to the city, I found it most unusual. I dont think we ever touched a bag or opened a door the ENTIRE time. They also proceeded to send us up a comp. chilled bottle of FINE sake. And about an hour later a chilled comp. bottle of Vos water, and about the time we were talking about that, there came ANOTHER knock at the door with some amazing sweets and a menu of their restaurant (definately a must try). So anyone related to 60 Thompson reading this....GREAT JOB!......we WILL return.P.S Thanks Martin", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-11-25"}

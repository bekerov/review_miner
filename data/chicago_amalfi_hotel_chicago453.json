{"city": "chicago", "title": "Was a great hotel!", "text": "My husband and stayed at the Amalfi for 5 nights in September, and were thoroughly satisified with it. Bed and linens were great, breakfast on each floor very convenient. Rooms were very clean. They had a 'happy hour' each evening, of which we partook once, and it was very well done. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful, answered all our questions quite easily. The hotel is small, only 6 floors, and the view from our room was the street, but that was not a problem for us. If you are looking for a huge, bustling hotel, with staff falling all over themselves for you, or with a high priced cafe, this is not the place for you. We did all the touristy things in Chicago, and really enjoyed the friendliness of the people and the cleanliness of the city. We liked the location of the hotel, as it is between the north/south portions of the downtown, and was very convenient to each side of the river. So did a lot of walking, and taking the subway, bus. There is also a 7-11 just around the corner for incidentals. The hotel is very quiet.The thing we probably disliked most about Chicago are all the people on the streets asking for money, but I am sure that this is the way with most big cities, and they were not pushy to the point of being obnoxious.We really enjoyed our trip to Chicgo!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-01"}

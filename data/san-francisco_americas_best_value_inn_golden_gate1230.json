{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Nice accommodations in S.F. for $44 per night", "text": "I weas a bit wary of the Sea Captains Motel on Lombard St. as I had read a couple of negative reviews, but I wanted to spend a few days in S.F. and was traveling on a tight budget. Let me tell you, for $44 per night (plus tax, of course), you get a clean and spacious room with a clean and spacious bathroom and a TV with cable. I'm sure you could spend 3x the rate and get about the same thing in the same neighborhood, which is the Marina- a clean and safe area of the City. If you get a room toward the rear of the motel, the traffic noise from Lombard is not bad at all. And the staff was pleasant enough, despite allegations of rude treatment of guests in other reviews. And there's a Safeway grocery about a 1/2 mile walk away and frequent bus service on Lomabard and Chestnut Sts. to all parts of the City.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2003", "date": "2003-12-10"}

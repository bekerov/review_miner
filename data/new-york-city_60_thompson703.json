{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Not so luxe!", "text": "This property was a second choice to the Mercer which was full. The 60 has been around sometime, and the rooms show it. I had a deluxe king room which was spacious, but with a very small coat closet. Bathrooms need to be updated, and very basic. Towels we thread bare, and felt oh so Comfort Inn if you get my drift. Amenities by Fresh were not replenished and limited. The turn down service of Voss water and a brownie were a nice touch. But did not make up for a rather &quot;oldish&quot; room.The room had no writing desk, but a large sofa and seater with a coffee table. Although it did have a flat screen television, it has not caught up with the wi fi must have making it cumbersome to plug into the the net, with a plug tucked in the corner.Airconditioning felt so European -- that is since its winter, its all heat! What happens if you want some cold? I slept with the windows open (they open about 3 inches). I could not complain about the service. The bellmen were very helpful (oh yes, with large tips) and attentive. The concierge abit snooty, but passable.Its all about location, and the 60 fills that need. But if you must be in Soho as I just love to be, I would not stay again but make sure to book early for the Mercer.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-14"}

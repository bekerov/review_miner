{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "BED BUGS stay at your own risk!", "text": "The first night of our stay was fine. The room was clean, staff was friendly, we arrived late with no complications. Car had to be valeted (28$/night), but I guess that's to be expected in such a central location. The second night was not so peasant after our sheets were changed that morning. Woke up with several bed bug bites and went immediately to tell the receptionist who immediately apologized, switched us rooms, and had maintenance look into it. Not until we woke up on the third day with more bites did another receptionist apologize profusely and guaranteed that the room would be refunded for all 3 nights. Almost 2 weeks later I am still irritated from the several bites I received, my boyfriend has more bites than me, but hasn't reacted quite as badly, but has many noticeable bites on his arms, which is absolutely disgusting. So where the hotel was nice enough and our stay would have been perfect, its unfortunate that they have rooms infected with bugs. I would inquire about what they've done to treat the rooms before staying there or just hope you get a room that hasn't been infected.-itchy", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-05"}

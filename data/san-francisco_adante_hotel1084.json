{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Bargain rates - okay stay", "text": "The Adante Hotel is situated in the Tenderloin but it is within walking distance of Union Square. The area isn't so bad, but it's not great either. If you go past Geary St to another block (ex: O'Farrell), massage parlors are abundant, and so are the homelessness and prostitution. The Adante Hotel rates are cheap. The day that I checked in, I was given a particular room. When I returned that same day, I learned that all of my things were moved without my authorization into an even smaller room. To make up for the inconvenience, the manager gave me 2 free servings of draft beer for 4 nights (at the bar/cafe that is connected to the hotel. btw, that bar/cafe happens to have a couple of health code violations). I don't know about you - but draft beer isn't the best solution to ease my problems of having someone touch and move your personal belongings.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-10-26"}

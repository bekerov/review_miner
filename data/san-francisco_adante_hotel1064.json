{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Excellent value for money", "text": "We stayed at this hotel for two nights in September and it was excellent.As we were in a city centre I asked for a room on a high floor in a quiet area. When we checked in we were given room 711. This is on the top floor (I think) and right at the back. The room was really quiet and just what we wanted.We flew into town and got the BART train into the city. This was really easy and cheap $5.15 each and the hotel is only about a 5-10 walk from the train stop. If you do this I would however recommend you walk up Powell and along Geary st as opposed to taking a direct route from the train station to the hotel like we did. Unfortunately this takes you through the homeless area which wasn't too pretty.The hotel itself is clean, the room was big enough for us with an excellent bathroom. The shower was low but this seems to be the done thing in America as every hotel we stayed in had a low shower. The reception staff were helpful and gave us a handy map of the city which was excellent. They also marked out any areas to avoid.The breakfast is basic with Coffee, Juice, Toast and Cakes but this was more than enough to enable you to get out sightseeing quickly. The location was good, really close to the shops. The walk to the Pier, Alcatraz takes about 40 mins and involves a few hills, so if this is your main focus you might want to stay a little closer or get a tram.The only downside was the window in our room didn't lock, however when we looked at the drop out from it we realised no one would try it.In summary an excellent hotel and I would recommend to anyone going to San Francisco who doesn't want to spend all their money on hotels", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-09"}

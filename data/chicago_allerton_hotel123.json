{"city": "chicago", "title": "SOOO Small and Dark", "text": "The hotel was undergoing major construction and they neglected to mention that when I called for my reservation. They also neglected to mention that only one elevator was working and that my room was about a big as my 12 year old's closet.They didn't tell me there was no coffeemaker in the room or Minimal shelf space in the bathroom and barely enough space to turn around...I'm NOT exaggerating at all. The shade was broken. The full size bed was a a stretched twin at best.They forgot to &quot;remind&quot; me that there was no business center as advertised. No fax, no computer, no hotspot...no NOTHING. There was SOME good...The front desk clerk was nice enough to print my boarding pass so I could get the h*ll outta there. Also, the TV flat screen was nice and it is sooo close to the mile and very convienent to walk away and forget what a horrible room you have.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-23"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Relaxed unassuming elegance", "text": "Our first stay in Chicago and we are so glad that we chose the Amalfi. They were helpful and nice from the minute we stepped onto the curb. During our 3 day stay, we were treated as well as if we were the paying for the presidential suite. Not a slacker or snob in the group. And the room was well decorated and comfortable even though it was small. Everything is convenient in the room as well as in the hotel. The morning pastries, etc. are better than any hotel that I have been in and the appetizers with complementary drinks in the evening are a great bonus! We will definitely stay again during our next visit.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-28"}

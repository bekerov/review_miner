{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Good Deal Clean Room Safe Area...", "text": "I stayed at this hotel in Jan of 2005 for 3 nights. We stayed on the 3rd floor. The rooms were nice and clean. No elevators. Rooms decorated in art deco style. Decent sized room for NYC. Hotel located in a residential/resteraunt area. LOTS of great little resteraunts and bars in the area...lots of night life with nice friendly people, no obnoxious dance clubs. You must have your room key to get in the front door and there was always a friendly attendant at the front desk, which made us feel safe. Located within walking distance to times square and close to the theatre district, but I'd rather be a little closer to a subway station, but if it's nice weather then you don't mind walking a bit to save a few hundred bucks.Breakfast is included in your stay (rare for NYC) and they had a large assortment of fresh pastries, bagles, coffe, tea, juice and muffins.There were only 2 things we found to be negative about this hotel:Our room faced the street, which is VERY noisey 24 hrs a day and the walls are pretty thin too! we could hear the people in the next room talking! and people getting back to their room at 3am were always noisey in the halls. The second thing was the heat...no thermostat in your room, so you can't control your temp...our room was SO hot the first night...then we learned to leave the window open during the day and it was fine for the last 2 nights.All in all if you visting NYC to see the sites this is a great place for you to stay and save some cash! I would recommend.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-02-06"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Hotel", "text": "This is a nice hotel in a great location. I had heard that the rooms were so small as to be laughable, but our room was not small at all. The concierge was very helpful, and the hotel was clean and attractive. If you're claustrophobic, you might want to avoid the elevators. I would definitely stay there again.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-24"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great location and high quality hotel", "text": "The Argonaut is in a great spot - just a couple of minutes away from all of the Fisherman's wharf attractions. The hotel is of a high standard - good service, decent sized rooms (we had a standard), nice amenities etc. San Fran is not a cheap town and the Argonaut is priced accordingly, but I think it's reasonable.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-22"}

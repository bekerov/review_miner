{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great hotel great location", "text": "I had not even looked at this hotel because rates were listed at over $300. But then Orbitz had a 24 hour sale with rooms for half price. Since this was lower than prices posted on their website, Amalfi gave us the rate and upgraded to a Suite. The rooms were large, nicely furnished, and quiet even though it was on second floor right by Harry Caray's bar while Cubs and Sox were in the playoffs. We loved the happy hour with nice cheeses, salamis, roasted veggies, and bruschetta plus the comprehensive bar with signature cocktails etc. Breakfast served on each floor, so you can take it to your room and enjoy the chocolate croissants, yogurt, fruit, bagels, and cream cheese. Staff very friendly and quickly responsive to requests for help in the room, getting the Wi-fi going, etc. We loved our time there and will definitely stay again if we can get a rate around $200 again.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-12"}

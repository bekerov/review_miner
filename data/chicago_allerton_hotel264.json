{"city": "chicago", "title": "Had a great time at the Allerton", "text": "Just got back from staying at Allerton and I liked it a lot. After doing an early check in we got to the room and it was smaller than normal hotel rooms but for two people It was nice. I was pleased with the remoldeled look at the hotel. Although a few minor problems I wasn't concerned because they could happen anywhere (ie. forgotton washcloths, delivary of towel to wrong room). If you have read the other reviews I can testify that the elevators are small and there are only 3 elevators for 20 something floors...Thankfully we were on the 6th floor and could take the stairs to the 3rd floor which is where the lobby and elevator to the ground are. This hotel is central to everything you want to be close to...Free Trolly, several malls, shops, food, Walgreens (came in handy at 2am), and much more. I would stay here again.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-07-19"}

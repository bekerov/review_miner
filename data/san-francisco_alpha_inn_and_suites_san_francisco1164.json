The rooms were big and nice. They had a free parking space too. Bus stop is just outside the hotel for golden gate bridge and 1 block to 30 number bus which can take you to union square/chinatown, etc. so a good location .walsgreen just in front . ATMs and Banks 2-3 blocksNot bad for the price.", "hotel": "alpha_inn_and_suites_san_francisco", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-12-06"}

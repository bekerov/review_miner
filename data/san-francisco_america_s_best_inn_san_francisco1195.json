Motor inn layout, 3 storeys, elevator, free parking. Excellent location: 10min brisk walk to Ghirardelli Square, 15min to Fisherman's Wharf. Helpful front desk staff. Provides soap, shampoo, lotion, coffee maker, hairdryer, iron and board, microwave, refrigerator, room clock, air-conditioning, coffee and tea whole day at lobby, free muffins and danish for breakfast. Only problem was the traffic noise: it is on Van Ness Ave, next to traffic lights - the starting and stopping of vehicles (especially buses) create a lot of noise. Light sleepers beware! Ask for rooms at the rear. ", "hotel": "america_s_best_inn_san_francisco", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-05-27"}

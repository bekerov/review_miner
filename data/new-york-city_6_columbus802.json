We were surprised by an upgrade to a penthouse suite due to a cancellation! The suite was amazing! Clean, very spacious, nice amentities. Everything we could need and if not, the staff was always willing to help with anything you would want or need. The location was awesome, across the street from Central Park and Time Warner Bldg.The staff at 6 Columbus was young, attentive, courteous, friendly,more than helpful, and very professional. The staff at the hotel made our visit better than expected and we will definately return.We didn't try the hotel restaurant but did have room service-continental breakfast and it was on time, and very satisfying. Great place to start and end your visit in NYC.There is a store right at the corner if you forgot anything or want cold drinks/snacks/etc.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-09"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Terrible!!!!!", "text": "The hotel is a disaster! First of all - when we arrived, no one offered to help us with our luggage (and their check in is on the second floor) We had to get our stuff upstairs in very tiny and super packed elevators!!Worse - they refused to honor our reservation for a king size delux room that we paid extra for - saying that they owe nothing to Orbitz or to us becasue we did not book with them direct. After we complained and asked for a manager, they promised to move us to a suite the next day. When we returned from a day of walking exhausted, they said &quot;sorry- you were not moved- someone dropped the ball...&quot; Finally, they agreed to move us to a room away form the elevator, and actually gave us a room which was smaller and the bed a Full size without even telling us they were going to do that!! But - the luxury item we did get was a mini fridge! Imagine! In this hotel the mini fridge is &quot;first come first serve&quot; - This is worse than a motel 6! The staff is just lying, not caring whatsoever for the customers, and irresponsible!The hotel - although they claim a renovation - has old dingy bathrooms, no mini friges, tiny rooms (not only the mini - all of them), and no elevator lobby making teh whole thing a fire hazard! Imagine right outside your room door is a 20 story high shaft that opens up to your front door. If anything happened, you would be trapped by the fire in your room. And certainly the staff would be the first to run away leaving everyone there. In any case - a disaster - terrible place!!!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-07"}

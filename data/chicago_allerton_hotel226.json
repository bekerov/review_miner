{"city": "chicago", "title": "Traveler Beware!!", "text": "Our stay at the Allerton at 701 Michigan Avenue began and ended on a bad note. We ended up paying $63.00 more per night than our reserved &amp; confirmed quote. We were also one queen size bed short of the reservation for six adults which caused major inconvenience. They only gave us linens for two so we ended up tipping someone just to get our first set of towels.The valet parking fees (38.00 per day + tip) and the room occupancy tax (22.95 per day) are NOT included in the room rates quoted. Eventhough I called the day before we got there to confirm the parking and valet fees and any other hidden costs and were told they were all included in our room rate and that we were being given a discount because of our surgery (transplant &amp; recipient)at North Western that week. Nothing I was told over the phone was true including the room rates so my confirmation number was useless. The staff at the desk were very indifferent and even after the surgery removing my kidney and all that that entails...the only thing I can say that made my week in Chicago miserable was the stay at the Crowne Plaza. We have even contacted our lawyer to recover some of our cost. Get anything they say to you over the phone in writing...since their word is no good.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-02-08"}

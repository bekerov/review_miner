{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great deal", "text": "This is a great hotel for someone who isn't going to spend a lot of time there...i.e. there is no pool/spa/gym. However our room and bathroom were very clean. The staff were very nice and helpful. It was so close to Union Square (about 4 short blocks) and the start of the Cable Cars (a few streets down). My friend and I were even able to walk to Chinatown in 20 minutes but public transportation is right outside the door if you are not up for walking. There is a daily continental breakfast included in your stay and if you want something more there is a really cute cafe attached to the lobby. My friend and I took the airport shuttle from the hotel for $14 or you can catch the BART which is a few blocks away.All in all I thought this hotel was excellent for the $85/nt price tag right in the middle of the more expensive hotels. I am going to suggest it to everyone I know planning on visiting San Francisco.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-11-16"}

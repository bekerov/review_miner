{"city": "chicago", "title": "Quirky hotel with good location and great service.", "text": "The hotel is located on the main shopping street. It is down the street from a Walgreens and 4 blocks from the L (subway). It is laid out in a strange manner, with the front desk in the second floor next to the restaurant. Also some of the elevators only go down to 2, which can be a hassle. The hotel itself is quiet, however, its location ensures constant ambulance sirens, as well as construction sounds one block down. The restaurant is minimalist and elegant, however, I found it to be overpriced. Orange juice was $7. I paid $25 for a simple juice, tea, bagel breakfast. Room service is efficient and the staff is very pleasant. I ordered risotto for dinner and it was fabulous. I was upgraded to a larger room upon arrival. The room was abundant in closet space, clean, with abundant windows with superb views. The layout, once more, was strange- the door leads into a small sitting area that turns towards an office which turns again towards the bedroom. However, it was a comfortable room and great value. The bathroom was clean with a simple hair dryer and L'Occitanne toiletries. Overall the hotel is very nice. I would describe it as modern, not artsy. If you do choose the Allerton, be sure to head over to the business center and use their free internet.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-03-11"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Good Location Average Rooms Awful WiFi", "text": "Stayed in the hotel for 8 days after the end of a road trip. It was probably a bit long, but the airline was to blame for that. I like the location - close to cool parts of Chesnut and Union streets. The room we had was a decent size. Bed was comfortable enough but the pillows had certainly seen better days. Likewise, the towels all felt like they'd been washed beyond their life some time ago. Would also be nice if the guy at the front desk spoke English.If you need wireless Internet access during your stay, it would be best to avoid this motel. It's clearly been set up by overzealous IT geeks who think it's nice to have you need to constantly login to use it, and it dumps you out randomly every few minutes, requiring a new login to get you back online. And to top it off, once you do login, you get directed to the Alpha Inn web site, NOT to the site you were trying to visit! Massively frustrating!", "hotel": "alpha_inn_and_suites_san_francisco", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-27"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "a sanctuary in the city", "text": "From the moment you pull up to the entrance of 60 thompson you know you will not be disappointed. Upon entering the hotel we were greeted by a very friendly and professional doorman.The entrance can be a little confusing because there are 2 lobbies. The ground floor had these lovely fragrant votive candles. The young lady who greeted us here was also very polite and directed us to the &quot;check-in&quot; lobby located one floor up. The room itself was heavenly. If you are used to NY standards with regards to space then you will not be disappointed. If you are someone who loves large rooms, then you may want to find another hotel. We found the room sufficient. It was a King superior room, which we got for $175/night - a total steal! The only down side was that the roof top lounge was not open because the weather was not warm enough and there were some renovations taking place. None of which bothered us at all.Also the bathroom was spectacular - even took digital pictures of it so I could redo my own personal restroom at home.The lounge down stairs was also very nice. It was very mellow, more of either a pre or post party place to have a drink.For a place that was so trendy it had no attitude problem, like most of the other NY hotels. (The front desk staff brought me a new toothbrush when i told them i forgot mine.) They were also helpful in recommending a nice massage parlour and made the booking themselves.Besides all that, the hotel is located in the best part of the city. I have lived in Manhattan and if I could ever afford it, I would live in Soho! It is close to lots of restaurants and boutiques. And it's just a beautiful area to walk around. If you have never been to NY then this place will give you the best opinion of the city.You can't go wrong with this place - seriously.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-05-17"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "High Standard in Central Location", "text": "This was our secong stay at the Allerton having stayed there about 5 years ago. The Hotel was good then and is still up to the same high standard. Yhe Staff where all extremely helpful from the moment we arrived until we left. The room was excellant and the bathroom worked perfectly. The location of this Hotel is great for shopping and if you get a travel pass you can get the bus to all the tourist locations easily enought. As I said this was my secong stay here and I look forward to many future stays in the future.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-04-05"}

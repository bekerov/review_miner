{"city": "chicago", "title": "Wonderful Hotel", "text": "I stayed in the Amalfi over Memorial Day weekend with my fiance and we had a great stay and experience. Our room was nice and clean, with a comfortable pillow top king size bed. The bath products are Aveda and that will win me over any day. The rooms do have thin walls but I think that's pretty typical. It's true that there is a complimentary cocktail hour from 5:30-7:00. You can get nearly any cocktail you want and there is a selection of wine and beer. The Amaflitini, their signature drink, wasn't my kind of drink (I'm a dirty martini kind of gal) but lots of folks really liked it. Another perk is that you can rent movies for free and watch them in the comfort of your bed. We're not usually one to watch a movie on our vacation but we were completely exhausted on our last evening there. So we watched a movie after our dinner and walk. The location is perfect. It's a few blocks away from Michigan Ave and all the shops. It's right in the middle of a heavy populated restaurant area and the restaurants are even open late. It's also close to several public transportation stops. All of this is in walking distance.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-09"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "BEST BUDGET HOTEL IN SF! Book the suite!", "text": "I booked a suite for two nights in July. The location is incredible! Great restaurants all within walking distance, the Palace of Fine Arts is a short walk away and... it's located on Lombard! I've seen 2 complaints on this site about this hotel that I too noticed. 1) no A/C and 2) bad smell. First, you're in San Francisco - even the hottest days are bearable with no A/C. We stayed in July and with the windows opened and the fan blowing, it was quite comfortable. And the smell someone mention: it's the smell from the carpet... and it's only in the halls, not the room. I've stayed at well over a dozen budget hotels in this city, and this was by far the best. Be sure to book the suite. For just a few more bucks a night, you get a large room with a big bay window. We got a comfortable king size bed, a pull-out sofa, a fridge, a microwave, a coffeemaker and Comcast digital cable and free Wi-Fi! Only 2 real complaints from me: 1) no free breakfast and 2) the room I stayed in had no real window in the bathroom and it was a bit stuffy in there after a shower - there was an exhaust fan, though. The man I encountered in the office could not have been any nicer. Excellent stay! You will not find a better budget hotel in the city!", "hotel": "alpha_inn_and_suites_san_francisco", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-16"}

The location is perfect, because it is in a quiet nieghborhood but also one or two blocks from all the excitement of the theatre district and Times Square. The staff was very pleasant, and the people at the front desk are very friendly and helpful. I plan to stay there everytime I visit New York City. Highly recommended.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-06-29"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Perfect Plaza Crowned Our Holiday", "text": "I spent about three hours on the internet one day looking at hotels for our five days in Chicago - three hours well spent when I found the Allerton Crowne Plaza. $65 a night, for two people in a king size room with all perks and mod-cons included? There had to be a catch, but no - when we arrived we found it was the perfect hotel in the perfect location - right on Michigan Avenue near the top-end designer stores (Tiffany, Armani etc.) between the historic Water Tower square and the Chicago Tribune building, five minutes walk from a metro station. The price doesn't include breakfast but there is an upmarket (i.e. well lit and soul-less) restaurant and bar if you are too lazy to stroll down the street to one of Chicago's many brilliant eateries. Spotlessly clean, utterly modern, friendly and helpful staff, quiet, secure, and comfortable. What more could you ask for?", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-05-31"}

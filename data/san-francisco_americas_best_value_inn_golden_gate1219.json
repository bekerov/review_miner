{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "UNBELIEVABLE Experience!", "text": "This is the review that Expedia WOULDN'T let me post:My wife and I booked this place through Expedia. We chose it for its proximity to Fisherman's Wharf and the free parking on site.When we arrived, we found out that the free parking was limited to about the first ten cars or so, and everyone else would have to park tandem and leave ther keys at the front desk.So far, no biggie -- we had a rental car. We were assigned room 218, which according to the elevator is on the THIRD floor. (We'll use that as benchmark warning for all hotels in the future.)The room was servicable, and I decided to plonk down on the bed for a quick nap before we hit the town.I pulled the sheets back, and dropped down into a recent PUDDLE of undetermined liquid on the mattress! (Yes, it was at crotch level, and we came to the same conclusion as to its origin.)We called the front desk and a maid arrived promptly. She surveyed the situation and called the front desk for further assistance.A man arrived shortly therafter, surveyed the situation, and asked me -- accusingly -- &quot;WHAT DID YOU DO?&quot;I set him straight, and they proceeded to strip the bed, and then they FLIPPED the soaking wet mattress OVER, so that the wetness would be the problem of room 118 (on the second floor).By this time we were on the phone to Expedia, demanding to change our hotel. Expedia said they would find us a room at another hotel OWNED BY THE SAME GUY, but we declined, as not changing the sheets between guests would seem to be an ownership problem.We we returned home, and tried to post this review to Expedia, we discovered that we weren't the first people to discover that this property didn't always change sheets between guests, but we may have been the first to discover a fresh &quot;puddle&quot; of evidence!", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-11"}

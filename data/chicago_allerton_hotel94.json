{"city": "chicago", "title": "Fantastic at The Allerton Hotel", "text": "My girlfriend and I stayed for 8 nights at the Allerton for our summer holiday to Chicago. The location is unbeatable - the Magnificent Mile is one second away. If you like shopping and brands such as Apple, Nike, Tiffany and Ralph Lauren then it is the place to stay. The building is beautiful. The hotel has been renovated fantastically. Ok the lifts can be an amusing experience, but don't let that put you off. The room was exceptionally clean and well equipped. It wasn't huge but was more than comfortable. The best bit about the Allerton though, has to be the fantastic staff. Every single staff member that we came across were exceptionally friendly, kind and went out of their way to ensure that our stay was perfect.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-08"}

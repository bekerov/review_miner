{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great deal for boutique hotel blocks away from Union Square", "text": "stayed for 9 nights. great price for a decent place just several blocks away from Union Square, shopping malls, BART, etc. TV was old but servicable and offered cable with no snowflakes. Room was tight but manageable...was only a place to store things and sleep. Restroom could be upgraded but still clean. Continental breakfast in lobby free. Had free internet access in room (cable). Great front desk help. Signed up city tours and shuttle service to airport thru front desk. If walking around late at night...stay on main road (Geary) dont stray off to side alley streets. Area is close &quot;ghetto&quot; area. Usually don't bother you but you never know what will happen.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-28"}

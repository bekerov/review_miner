{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great time at the Thompson", "text": "Booked an excellent rate at the 60 Thompson through the Quikbook website for 7 days and had a fantastic time.Location: excellent location really in the heart of Soho. Possibly the Mercer hotel is better located but also far more expensive.Vibe: the Vibe of the hotel is quite young, with loud music etc. On friday and saturday evenings the hotel lobby turns into a bar, joining with its actual bar &quot;thom bar&quot;. We liked this aspect of the hotel but you should eb aware of it.Service: as we met friends at the hotel who were travelling to new york from europe, we made all of our luch and dinner reservations through the concierge about a month before we were due to arrive. The Concierge was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about new york, and added greatly to our wonderful experience of the big apple.Having said that, you get the feeling that the large number of VERY young staff means that there is a bit more gloss than actual hotel experience going on here.Rooms: stayed in a superior king room which was nicely appointed but could have been a tad larger considering its category.Bathroom: our room had a shower in teh bathtub and our friends had a shower only which may have been preferable.Nice Touches: Bottle of Voss water each evening along with a fudge cake was a nice touch.Hotel restaurant Kittichai has good asian food and is definately worth trying one evening.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-02-05"}

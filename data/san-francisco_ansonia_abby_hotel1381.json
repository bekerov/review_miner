{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "The Ansonia should be your last choice", "text": "While a bit quaint in decor, the Ansonia is most truly the worst hotel I have experienced for customer service. Some of the front desk staff are most friendly and helpful, while others do not hesitate to show they hold guests in utter contempt. For a traveller on a budget who only has to spend one night, my suggestion is to pay extra and stay near the airport. If you are staying any longer, investigate the area further before committing to the Ansonia. If I would have know earlier how unfriendly this hotel is to the paying customer, I would not have given it a second look. While proximity to events downtown is desirable, Ansonia has only location as a drawing card, and that is most definitely not enough. I have found much better lodgings in the area now, and will truly never return to the Ansonia. Business or pleasure travel should not have the stress of this environment. My overall rating of the Ansonia is less than one out of ten, and would not recommend it, either for dollar value or atmosphere. San Francisco is a great city, but my experience at the Ansonia has genuinely affected this visit.", "hotel": "ansonia_abby_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-11-14"}

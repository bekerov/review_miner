{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Miracle on 46th Street", "text": "God blessed me with a reservation at 414. It is simply a darling and comfortable place. It is where fine meets affordable, and is a wonderful place to stay for anyone looking to be close to theater, Restaurant Row, Times Square, etc. It is safe, picturesque, clean, comfortable, and an absolute delight. I had prayed for a good, affordable place to stay during the Christmas rush of December, and finally (on my birthday!) 414 called, having kindly put me on a waiting list some days before, to let me know I could have reservations. I said, &quot;Thank You, Lord Jesus!&quot; What a relief and surprise that was for me. I enjoyed my stay a lot, and the concierges (particularly Michael) were helpful and friendly. Michael helped me with restaurant choices and getting a car to the airport. I was very impressed and have already made reservations to go back again. D.

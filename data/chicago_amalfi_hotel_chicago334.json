{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Hotel Great Stay!", "text": "The Amalfi Hotel is a small hotel that caters to its' customers. They really care about making your stay as pleasant as possible. My husband and I stayed for the Columbus Day Weekend, Friday to Monday. We both ran in the Chicago Marathon and were surprised when breakfast was out early on the floor and also by the front desk a table was set up with Bananas and granola bars. Very Impressive! The complimentary breakfast and cocktail hour were very tasty and more than we expected. Our room was very comfortable and the showers were so wonderful we did not want to come out. Name brand Aveeda bath products and high thread count sheets were a plus as were the Ghirardelli Chocolates and turn down service every night. We will definitely return on our next visit to Chicago!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-14"}

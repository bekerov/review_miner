On arrival the receptionists (mainly seem to be students working part-time) were friendly and helpful. We were on a motorcycle tour and they recommended overnight parking in the adjacent street. The room was small but clean, the breakfasts were fresh and plentiful. The area is really central to the main shopping area, Macy's is only 5 mins walk. We ate at the Grand Cafe a couple of blocks east and would recommend it, great atmosphere.

If all you need is a well located clean room, don't hesitate to book the adante.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-21"}

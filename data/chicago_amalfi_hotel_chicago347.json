{"city": "chicago", "title": "Amazing Amalfi!", "text": "Stayed for 3 nights this past weekend. Loved the location, central to everything. Walked everywhere, Millenium Park, Magnificent Mile, River, close to El train. Liked the evening cocktail reception, try their signature Amalfitini, it's delicious. The room was big, clean, and the bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've had in a long time. Most of the staff was very friendly, some of the front desk staff was a little standoffish, some wouldn't even look up when you walked by, but everyone else, bellman, porters, housekeeping were so friendly it made up for it. I saw the Batman movie &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; at the Imax theatre at the Navy Pier while I was there, and it was nice to see so much of Chicago in the movie since it was filmed in Chicago, and the Amalfi Hotel even makes a brief cameo in the movie. I would definitely stay here again!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-06"}

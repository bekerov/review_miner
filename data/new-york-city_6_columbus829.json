Super thin walls I could hear every noise/shower/music/conversation that were taking place in the adjacent rooms. There was a party taking place on my floor that wasn't moved till early in the morning so basically I didn't get any sleep and it totally ruined the next day for me. The only pluses were that the rooms were clean, staff is nice, I got a cheap rate using quikbook, and the location.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-03-23"}

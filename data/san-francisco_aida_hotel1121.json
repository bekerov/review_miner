{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Run Away!", "text": "As downscale as it gets in Frisco - don't be fooled by Aida's location oin Market Street, home of Nordstrom, Bloomingdales and the world-famous SF cable car. This is a bum location. Period.The Aida is right in the heart of 4/5 blocks of homeless people and the associated down side this brings. Filthy streets, urine aromas, bins full of G*d knows what - this is realy disturbing especiallly when you have children in tow (as we did).The hotel is what it is - a cheap, 1-star place to rest your head. Nothing else. No frills although for 5 of us the room was deceptively spacious, clean enough without being too gross and staff were helpful enough - I think they hate the location as much as anyone and behave accordingly.The clientele were international and realy genuinely decent folk. Regular chats in the lobby around a breakfast of do-nuts and coffee were really pleasant.Any web-site that promotes this an okay location in Frisco is mis-leading (as we found out). If you are a student with a budget, it is okay (just); in every other circumstance, do not book a stay at the Aida UNTIL he SF authorities help the homelessness peoplkes of the city with their plight.", "hotel": "aida_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-22"}

The staff is wonderful and made us feel most welcome. The rooms are cozy. The beds and pillows are excellent...even our teens commented on how comfortable they were. Although a few blocks from a subway stop, thought the location was great for us...close enough to Times Square, but far enough away to be on a quiet street with a neighborhood feel. It was a sweet place to return to after a full day and evening of seeing the sights. Nice little kitchen with good coffee and continental breakfast and fresh fruit. The price is right if you are on a budget and/or traveling with a group. Great experience!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-01"}

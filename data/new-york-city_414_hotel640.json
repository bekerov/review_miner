{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Good and bad", "text": "We went to this hotel because we had read reviews on this site. The room was great, the bed comfortable and the room and bathroom clean and a good sizeAs for the staff, Mike was great, very friendly and helpful. However another (female) member of staff was on in the mornings and was downright surly and rude. This did kind of spoil it.The location is great and we walked to a lot of places and Mike was very helpful in suggesting restaurants.One last thing, we were on the top floor and had a fire escape to right in front of the windows. You cannot, however, lock the windows. Even with the locks shut tight it is possible to open the windows.The breakfast was great, as was the constant supply of tea and coffee. I would have given the hotel 4 stars were it not for the very unfriendly member of staff.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-01-30"}

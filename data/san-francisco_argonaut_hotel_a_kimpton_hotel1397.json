{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Excellent location excellent service", "text": "We stayed 2 nights. The rooms were cozy. It felt like you were in a cruise ship because of the nautical themes. Complimentary wine tasting every 5pm (this past week they were show casing Francis Coppola cabs). It was pretty good. The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is so close to a lot of cool spots such as the fishermans wharf, dining shopping, chinatown, and the muni cars.Also, they have complimentary WIFI, which is always good.I would recommend you purchase the Hotel Package with the Complimentary overnight parking. The parking can get very steep in SF. The overnight parking at Arganaut is about $40 per night. We got the complimentary parking package so we didn't need to pay for the overnight parking.The hotel only has 4 floors. We got a room on the fourth floor. The sheets were very clean, the bed was very comfortable. The bathrooms were very clean and the stone in the bathroom floor felt very clean. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Arganaut. We definitely would stay there again.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-06"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Rate made a Great Hotel", "text": "We stayed at the 6 Columbus for 5 nights at the end of Jan 2009. We got a superb rate through Quikbook, which made this hotel very affordable. I booked a Queen superior, as i had been informed that the pod rooms were very small. If i was indeed given a queen room, then those pod rooms must be a broom cupboard. Having said that the room was more than adequate for the 2 of us, as we did not intend to spend a lot of time in the room anyway. The only downside to the size of the room, was lack of storage for clothes, and given that it was winter we had a lot of bulky clothes, but we managed.The room was on the 5th floor at the back of the hotel, with a nice view of the shaft, but didn't think this mattered as I wasn't going to spend my time looking out of the window.The under floor heating in the bathroom was indeed a nice touch, as other's have mentioned, but couldn't quite work out how it worked. The shower was great - powerful &amp; hot! The only downside of the bathroom was the miniscule towels - no good for wrapping up wet hair! The mini bar was packed full, but didn't try anything as there is a Duane Reade next door. Service at the hotel was very good, very attentative door staff, and it was nice to receive a plate of cookies half way through our stay. The bar staff where also very pleasant in the Blue Ribbon bar &amp; restaurant (we did not eat there). The cleaning staff where a little noisy in the mornings, but really we should have been up and seeing the sights anyway.This hotel is in a great location, right opposite the subway, and over the way from Central Park, a few nice bars &amp; restaurants nearby. I would definitely recommend this hotel, but only if you can get a great rate, as otherwise i think it is quite pricey.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-02-04"}

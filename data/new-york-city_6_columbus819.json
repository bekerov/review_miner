{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great hotel great location", "text": "We booked a queen superior room for 6 nights and were upgraded to a queen deluxe at check in. The room was a good size for New York and to a good standard. Staff were excellant and very friendly, we really couldn't fault anything about the hotel during our stay. The hotel is right at the edge of Central Park and in a very good location for visiting the rest of Manhatten. Prices seemed to change quite a bit before we booked and we got an excellant rate on the hotel website. The hotel is very close to Whole Foods in the Time Warner building which was brilliant for a wide range of good food. Would definitely stay there again.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-29"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "old world charm", "text": "This is definitely a hotel with a more European feel. It is older with small rooms and bathrooms. We got a great rate on this hotel through Hotwire, and were able to upgrade to a larger room. Our family simply loved this hotel. My daughters thought it reminded them of the Disney movie &quot;Tower of Terror&quot;, but in a good old fashioned way. You simply cannot beat the location and we found the staff to be friendly and gracious. The lobby and elevators can get crowded. But everyone we encountered took this in stride. This hotel is also featured in Priceline so great deals are out there and worth it!!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-03-30"}

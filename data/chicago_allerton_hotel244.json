{"city": "chicago", "title": "Fantastic Experience", "text": "We really enjoyed this hotel. It is in a great location - right in the heart of the Magnificent Mile - easy walking to many shops, landmarks and great restaurants. We found everyone (bellhops, housekeeping, registration) we encountered to be very pleasant and always willing to help. We did not have any situation that required us to interact with management so I don't have an opinion on that. As members of the Priority Club we were upgraded to a mini-suite which had a large king size bed in one room and a sleeper sofa in the other. We had our 2 kids for one night of the stay and the sleeper sofa was a bit small but fine for them. The room was located at the end of the hall so we had views from 3 sides of the building - 2 of which were gorgeous views of the skyline and you could even see the lake. The bathroom was fine - I didn't think it was too small and there was a glass shelf running the length of the bathroom for storing toiletries that was perfectly adequate for us. Also, I think our rate was very good - we booked on the hotel's website and took the internet rate (it has restrictions - such as no cancellation) - it was the most reasonable rate I could find for a hotel in this location. We did have our car and were charged the $36 / night for parking but we were not charged on our last day and we didn't leave until the noon checkout. We did not have any problems dealing with the parking or retrieving our car when we needed it.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-13"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Fabulous Location", "text": "We stay in NYC about 6 times a year in the off season when we can find decent rates. We have stayed in many boutique hotels including Hotel Giraffe, The Muse and The Benjamin. We booked the smaller king room at 6 Columbus and it was small but how much time do you stay in the room? It was clean and the bathroom was clean and staff was great. We ask for a quiet room and it was very quiet. The hotel was great and you can't beat the location. There is no roof top bar. I read about that either on quickbook or their own site but when we went to locate it all we found was dirty laundry. There is a huge whole foods across the street to peruse including lots of food to go. We walked Central Park twice which is right across the street and we could walk to our Broadway show. We booked directly with the hotel and the same day found a considerable lower rate on quickbook. I called the hotel and they matched the rate. We will definitely stay here again.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-23"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Impressed", "text": "Great little hotel on a quiet street in Soho. Gorgeous room, got upgraded to a King. Bathroom sumptuous and slick. Great view, both in the room and via the skyline cam on the flatscreen TV. Staff, with the exception of just one chilly front desk clerk, was friendly and helpful. Rooftop bar was gorgeous and fun. Only one negative: very loud toilets. Irritating, day and especially night. I would stay there again, and plan to in the coming weeks.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-06-28"}

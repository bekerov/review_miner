{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great neighborhood", "text": "My partner and I had a early morning flight into NY, so when we got to the hotel, our room was definitely not ready. We didn't think it would be, as it was pretty early. The front desk was very courteous and said that they would hold our luggage and would call us on our cells as soon as it was ready. Luckily, the hotel is in a fantastic neighborhood with lots to see- lots of restaurants/ cafes &amp; a ton of hip boutiques. The hotel itself is very stylish. There was a fashion shoot going on in the lobby our first morning. The shower was a bit weird- the way it was designed allowed for water to get on the floor, but I guess that's what towels are for...-Our room didn't have a tub unfortunately- but when in NY who has time for a bath, I guess. The restaurant was nice- very swanky. The waiter accomodated to our dietary requests nicely. We ate early , so it was not packed, but it is definitely a place to see and be seen. The other people sitting near us were having some sort of fashion industry meeting- which kept us amused. The only bad thing I could say about the hotel is the sound carrying problem that someone already mentioned. We definitely heard people flushing their toilets/ and water thru the pipes which was a bit odd considering you are in such swanky surroundings. Also- the doors slam if not shut properly, so you constantly hear housekeeping and other guests slamming doors in the morning. You get over it pretty quickly though considering it's NY and you can't escape noise. Again- great neighborhood. Lots of things to do during the day-- and plenty of bars/ late night cafes near the hotel!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-21"}

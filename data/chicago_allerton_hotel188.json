{"city": "chicago", "title": "Location could not be better!", "text": "I stayed at the Allerton for a conference in mid-April. The conference was actually held at the hotel; so I experienced the continental breakfast and lunch; both were just splendid. The conference facilities on the 23rd floor were actually pretty cool; baroque/ornate rooms with fantastic views of the city.The location on the cusp of Streeterville / Gold Coast simply cannot be beat! Easy walking distance from the best shopping the city has to offer. There is also an Apple store across the street- remember that if you don't have your laptop and you need to use the internet, it's FREE!Checking in, I was given a complimentary upgrade to a suite, and because I was there alone, it was plenty of room for just me! Quite luxurious-- living room and bedroom both had TVs, and since getting to Chicago during a freak spring cold spell had been quite difficult, the free upgrade was very much appreciated! The waitstaff for the conference was lovely, the concierge(s) were always very helpful, even the room service staff went above and beyond. My only complaints were that the bathroom light/fan made a horrific, loud buzzing noise, and upon check in and check out, I found the service counter attendants to be unattentive and almost bored. Ooooh, and the restaurant/bar are scary. The bartender was unattentive and rude (w/no customers in the bar) and they still allow smoking. Blech.If I had the guaranteed of a suite, I would stay at the Allerton every time I was in Chicago!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-04-27"}

The perfect location the Argonaut!", "text": "Online presentations fall short of the full glory of this wonderfully restored and converted warehouse...now a luxury hotel in the heart of the San Francisco Wharf District. Wake up and find yourself in the middle of everything and wanting for nothing. The staff is always present and never noticed until you have a need. One could not ask for more in attention and care. The &quot;happy hour&quot; provides travelers a full hour to visit with others in San Francisco from all over the world. What a joyous exchange of chatter with so many people seeking to learn more about each other.Thanks, Argonaut, for the perfect ending to a 2-week road trip through some of the most incredible sites in America. We will be back.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-08"}

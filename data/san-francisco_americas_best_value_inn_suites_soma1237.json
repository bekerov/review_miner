{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Good basic hotel", "text": "Pleasant, fairly basic hotel about a mile from the centre of San Francisco. My room was nice and clean, and the furniture and bathroom appeared reasonably new. No coffee-making facilities or other frills, but that's not too surprising given the price. Breakfast consisting of coffee (no millk unfortunately, only whitener), juice and muffins/pastries is provided, and was perfectly adequate for me. Staff were pleasant, and the service good; wireless internet was also available.The location is ok, with good bus links to San Francisco airport, amongst other places. I felt reasonably safe walking to and from the city centre, particularly once I'd discovered the Folsom/4th Street route rather than 7th/Market. However, I was not keen to wander too far alone at night. Fortunately, there are a number of restaurants withing a block or two of the hotel, so this need not be a problem! There is also a small supermarket/convenience store next door.Overall, this hotel seemed to me to be a good choice for travellers looking for a base within walking distance of downtown San Francisco, but who don't wish to pay high prices. I would certainly consider staying here again, although I would also investigate options in the city centre.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_suites_soma", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-12-21"}

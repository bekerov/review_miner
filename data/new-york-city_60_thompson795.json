{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "It stunk!", "text": "Although the hotel itself was hip &amp; fun and we luckily didn't have a problem with loud neighbors, our recent two-night stay was ruined by the fact our room smelled like stale cigarette smoke the whole time we were there. At a certain point, it even smelled in the hallway outside our door. The front desk insisted we were on a non-smoking floor each time we complained, but who cares! It still smelled. They couldn't switch us the first night because the hotel was booked and the 2nd night there were no rooms available equal to what we already had. They did offer to put an ionizer in the room while we were at dinner and it did seem to help initially, but the smell was back again by the next morning. Although the room decor was sleek, the room overall seemed a little beat up. The bathroom wasn't anything that great either. Our king bed also seemed short and I'm not a tall person. The doormen were good but because the front desk did not really seem to care about our complaint, we were overall disappointed with service. Our smelly room interfered with what otherwise was a great time in NYC.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-05-03"}

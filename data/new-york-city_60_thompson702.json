{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Delightful boutique hotel in the village", "text": "Never having been to New York before, we were faced with 'where to start?' We wanted to get a flavour for 3 - 4 days, so wanted something central, comfortable, personable, and reliable. Trip Advisor reviews led us to 60 Thompson, and the hotel's website was attractive, so we gave it a go. We booked one of the executive rooms, and was not disappointed, given that the reviews led us to expect smaller rooms likely in need of a brush-up. The journey from JFK was a flat $45 in a yellow cab, and check in was fine. The front desk looked a bit untidy, but the young staff were friendly and cool. The room was fine. Crisp linens, clean and tidy, fresh. The place has a really good bar. Music is funky but not overly intrusive. Great long island iced teas! We only used the restaurant for breakfast, and we found this excellent. I recommend the home made meusli. Mostly very healthy options. Service on the whole was professional, unobtrusive. The location is perfect for walking around Soho, Grenwich Village, Little Italy, China Town, and is about 30 minutes from the financial district / ground zero, or depending on how many zillions of detours you make, can stroll up 5th Avenue for all the hullaballoo of the big shops. We'll be back. Warmly recommended.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-16"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Historic small rooms but an upgrade and free internet to boot", "text": "I spent four nights at the Allerton while attending a meeting at the Sheraton a few blocks away. The location is wondeful, the hotel is clean, and the prices were reasonable for what was a busy time in Chicago. My rate changed twice while I was there, but I knew that when booking. On check-in, I was greeted pleasantly with the message &quot;Mr. Traveler, we've upgraded you to a suiite!&quot; courtesy I think of my Prority Club status. The rooms are small, but the suite was nicely arranged -- living room with hide-a-bed, work desk, and television a short hall and the bedroom with a king bed. The layout meant there were windows on three different walls of the room.The room was clean and comfortable, plenty of hot water and towels and very quiet at the end of a hall. The restaurant is quite nice to look at, the food is okay, but there are many better places to eat in the neighborhood. I ate their my first night because it was late.The room comes with wired high speed internet access -- I think for $9.95 a day but when I opened my laptop I found no fewer than five free wi-fi channels available. I used one of them named Observation 2 (there was also an Observation 4). Since my room was line of site to the top of the Hancock tower a few block away I wonder if that is what I was accessing. In any case, a good strong, fast signal for free.All in all a great stay.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-05-18"}

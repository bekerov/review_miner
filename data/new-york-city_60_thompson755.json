{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Cool Thompson", "text": "Just returned from a 4 night stay, arrived to find a full on Vogue photo-shoot taking place - it's that sort of place!! Our room on the 12th floor was well proportioned and was quiet, our only criticism was that we only had a shower, unfortunately no bath.Whilst the Thompson has a cool vibe it is not a cold unwelcoming place, the staff are friendly and the service was particularly good in the Thom Bar. We had previuosly stayed in large uptown hotels, this is the complete opposite - we loved exploring SOHO and surrounding areas. PS A few doors up from the hotel is the Thompson Cafe(not related to hotel), it is small, quaint and great for a latte, breakfast or a light lunch.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-12-14"}

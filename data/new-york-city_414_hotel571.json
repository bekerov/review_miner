{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "in retrospect - not bad!", "text": "We had a split stay at this hotel and on first arriving I was a bit disappointed. Somehow it wasn't quite as charming as I had read about in these reviews. It looks shabby and needs a bit of a makeover.We were on the ground floor on both occasions, in two different rooms across from each other. The second room seemed much better (there was a very odd smell in the first one sometimes). The beds are clean and comfortable; the rooms were stifling at times; the breakfast adequate and the staff generally helpful and very pleasant. One member of staff seemed to be very new and as a result on more than one occasion was unhelpful e.g. he tried to tell me that the message flashing button on the phone was due to the weather. When I explained that we were expecting a message, he could not advise us how to access the message. As a consequence we had to wait 6 hours until someone else came on duty. By this time it was 11.00pm and we could not reply. That was our only disappointment however.There are plenty of restaurants around- all very reasonable. We liked 'Yum-yums' on 9the Ave (turn right at the lights) and a good Mexican on 9th (to the left at the lights, on a corner a couple of blocks up).We were able to walk to the main attractions- 414 is in a fabulous place. Overall, good value for money.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-09-03"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "great location", "text": "Room was clean and tidy with good furnishing but not large. Parking is cramped so you leave the keys at reception so they can move your can if necessary, this was fine. The best thing is the location and price. We strolled down lombard street (curly bit) and onto pier 39 and it took about 20 mins of walking. The breakfast is coffee/tea and doughnut/muffin, fine for a quick bite and morning drink before heading off.", "hotel": "america_s_best_inn_san_francisco", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-05"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Worst place ever stayed", "text": "Just came back from vacation with my son. The room was horribly small, no bathtub, the rooms are tilted and we had a beautiful view of the brick wall of the next building so sunshine was not an option. Amenities listed coffemaker in room (not there), Sony CD player (not there), even the ice buckets were nonexistent because evidently &quot;they hadn't been received yet&quot; according to the hotel. The manager of the bellmen gave us directions to a restaurant that were totally incorrect and in the wrong direction. The food was less than fair; the items on the kids menu cannot always be made since even hamburger buns are not available. The cable TV channels consist of one cartoon channel for kids which is fine if the child is under the age of 4. We even had to take our own luggage down when we left, no billing was left for us under the door and on the last day the housekeeper decided to come in at 9:15 a.m. despite the privacy sign and wouldn't leave. This was the worst place we have ever stayed.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-11"}

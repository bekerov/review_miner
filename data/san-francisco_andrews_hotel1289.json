{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Lots of Charm", "text": "Just returned from a trip to San Fran and stayed 1 night at the Andrew's Hotel and was very pleased with all aspects of the hotel. The property itself is from the early 1900's and has preserved much of the charm and character, but has the modern things we all desire; king size bed, radio, fridge, tv, dvd player, etc. The old fashion elevator with the sliding grate door is a step back in time.We had a 'sunny bay' room which overlooked the street and was plenty big. The bathroom was a bit small, so be warned for those that need more space.There is a continental breakfast of muffins, fruit, coffee and juice on each floor that you can enjoy in the privacy of your own room. There was also complimentary soda and water in the mini fridge, which was a very nice touch. There is no parking on-site, but we were directed to a local parking garage for $20 for 1 night (no in-and-out privileges).Location is near a trolley line and plenty of restaurants and bars in walking distance. It was also nice to stay somewhat away from the highly touristed areas.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-16"}

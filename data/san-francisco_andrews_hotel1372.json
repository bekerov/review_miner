{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Customer Service - the best!", "text": "We just got back from San Fran and the Andrews hotel was just the best. The service was excellent - Oscar the consierge was amazing - he knew so much and his recommendations for restaurants were right on. Dan, the bartender at the hotel's restaurant was friendly, plus the house wine you get as a guest of the hotel was very good - the Pinot grigio was yum and do get the calamari. The rooms were small but cozy and little things make a differerence like a small bud vase of flowers - it was such a pleasant surprise. Breakfast was great - each floor has their own breakfast set up - so easy which consisted of fresh fruit, pastries, coffee and fresh juice.The hotel is in walking distance to the trollies and buses so a car is not needed, but if you do drive in get tready for a 28.00 a day parking fee - you do get to go in and out though. We rented a car in oakland because we were traveling up to Napa - next time we'll rent in the city.We would definatly stay here again - what made this place stand out was CUSTOMER SERVICE - we have traveled all over the worls and have never had the attention nor the personal care as we did here at the Andrews.Enjoy", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-06-01"}

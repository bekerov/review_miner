{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Avoid", "text": "Was all set to say that this place is a good option for budget stay in SF, despite the central pool empty of water and filled with mud, crooked electrical outlets, and world's worst in-room coffee. Then, when I was checking out, I asked the owner if he could store my bags while I was out, and he refused to store them in the office. He said he could store them in the laundry room across the hotel complex. I asked him if he could show me where that was and he refused. When I said I was uncomfortable leaving the bags somewhere he would not show me, he tried to assure me that it was locked except when the employees were doing laundry (this did not seem all that secure). I asked again if he could store my bags in the office, and he refused, and then said, &quot;Now I won't store your bags at all.&quot; I said &quot;What?&quot; He said, &quot;Take your bags with you, I won't help you.&quot; We went back and forth like this a couple more times, until finally I had to beg him to take the bags, and even then, I had to lug the bag with my computer in it all around with me, since I decided only to leave my garment bag. In the end, the laundry room seemed semi-secure (although it was across the parking lot in the back, and it would have been easy for someone to take something out of a bag outside the sight of the manager or desk clerk). This owner does not understand that there is a minimum standard he has to provide; otherwise his hotel is all but useless to travelers.", "hotel": "alpha_inn_and_suites_san_francisco", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-12-07"}

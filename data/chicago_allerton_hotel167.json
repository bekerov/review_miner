{"city": "chicago", "title": "Very comfortable hotel", "text": "We stayed at the Allerton during the first week of August and found everything about our stay enjoyable. We had a &quot;handicapped room&quot; which was spacious enough for 2 people and nicely furnished. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet, we had a great nights sleep. The ride in the old style elevator was nostalgic for us. The front desk clerks were friendly. The location is superb. We parked at a reasonably priced garage on St. Claire and walked 5 minutes to the hotel. I'd definitely stay there again.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-13"}

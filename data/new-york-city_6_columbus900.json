{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Perfect!!!", "text": "Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at 6 Columbus. The hotel is situated midtown, opposite the Time Warner Centre and within walking distance of Times Square, Central Park and all the important shopping streets. The hotel is small and intimate, the staff are very attentive and the concierge is very helpful. He arranged a fab night out for us and put us on all the guest lists. I was expecting a pokey room given the reviews, but the 'Pod' room really wasn't that small... the room comes with a very comfy bed, designer edibles, ipod docking station, flat screen and the bathroom even has heated flooring( oh and an amazing power shower).The hotel houses a very popular New York sushi restaurant, the food was pretty decent. The hotel is on the same street as the Hudson hotel( pay a visit to the bar) and also the Mo bar at Mandarin Oriental( the view of the city is amazing).All in all, can't fault this hotel. Does everything a hotel should, very comfy, central location and excellent attentive staff.Will be my New York sleeping spot going forward!!!", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-27"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Perfectly acceptable", "text": "I got a very good price for a one night stay at this hotel, especially considering my stay was in the middle of the Memorial Day weekend. It's an older property, and that shows. Furniture shows wear. However, the room was sparkling clean, all the windows were new and fit well. There was a small refrigerator in the room, but no coffee maker. Oh well, I can live with that. Plenty of channels on the TV. My room was at the back of the property, and I think I had no neighbors, so my stay was very quiet -- except for someone who marched loudly down the outside walkway at 3:00 a.m.! Can't blame the management for that, though. The managers were friendly, efficient and courteous. Parking is limited, but again that was no problem. There are several breakfast restaurants within a block of the motel, so that worked well for me. Location is good, a block away from a very nice part of Chestnut Street in the Marina where you can find several good restaurants, as well as two movie theaters. The Presidio is nearby, and there are plenty of buses to take you wherever you want to go in the City. I would certainly stay here again.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-25"}

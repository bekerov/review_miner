{"city": "chicago", "title": "The Amalfi knows their stuff...", "text": "My girlfriend and I stayed at the Amalfi a couple weekends ago just for a nice girlie getaway. It was great! I was told it was four star however and I would rate it more like a luxury 3 star. Rooms were kinda small, but quite luxurious. Soft robes and slippers, aromatic Aveda products, comfy pillow top mattresses and silky sheets! We slept like a dream! I also loved the ipod alarm clock that I could plug my nano into it. The continental breakfast on each floor was nice to wake up to and roam out in our robes to. And the evening hors-deuvrs were yummy and almost a light dinner in and of themselves! Chocolates on our bed at night was nice! One of the very best things about this hotel is the staff. They are so helpful and Olga, the Information specialist you talk to on the phone when you stay there and need information about the hotel or the area is the sweetest person in all of Chicago! The Amalfi is in a great location, close to everything, including Harry Carry's restaurant which is right across the street and yummy! You can walk to the Magnificient Mile and to Navy Pier and just about anywhere downtown. It's also easy to access from the Blue Line Rail that comes straight from the airport for $2! A super deal! The Amalfi is all in all luxurious but not 4 or 5 star. It's a great place to stay, but not high-end. It's electic, comfortable, and very accomodating. One more thing: don't miss eating breakfast at the Bongo Room about 3 miles from the hotel...it's not quite walking distance (unless you want to jog there like me and my girlfriend me so that we could eat a bigger breakfast). But there pancakes are to die for and their omeletes are as big as your head! You may have to wait in line, but it's worth it!Have fun in Chi-town and enjoy all the joys of the city!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-13"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "A disappointment!", "text": "We selected this hotel because of a prior stay at the beautiful and luxurious 60 Thompson, another hotel in this hotel group. 6 Columbus was a big disappointment because the room king size room was small and dark, the carpet was worn, and the furniture was run down. The veneer of the dresser was peeling and the furniture looked as if it had been purchased at an inexpensive second hand shop. The plus was a nice bathroom and the shower had good water pressure. A big negative was the food smells that pervaded the hallway and the room--something that I was unpleasantly aware of throughout the stay. The bell staff is helpful and friendly, but the day manager was markedly unimpressed with my dissatisfaction about the quality of the room and the food smells. We would not stay there again, despite the good location.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-22"}

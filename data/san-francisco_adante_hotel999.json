{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Avoid - unless you can get a very very very good prize", "text": "we paid 160 ,- thorugh hotwire for a two star hotel with good location. The location is good. The hotel terrible. The room was a closet which looked like a flamingo with a love for Trinidad had exploded in it ( you will understand if you ever see it), queenseize  bed, holes in blankets and furniture, its view was a brickwall, no ac, a fan in the loft. It was ok clean but so depressing I felt like crying. Unfortunately it was late, we had our ten month old baby with us - so we stayed. The very sternlooking chinese man in the frontdesk ( manager I think) told us they hadn't a baby crip and declined our wish for room with a king bed, so it could fit the three of us.The breakfast next morning was as depressing as the room. The only uplifting thing was to canadian women who complained over the bird droppings and the dirty carpet in their room and got a discount ( 140 ,- instead of 199,-).If it had costed 70,- it would be all right - the canadian women called the hotel ' a scam'.Poor woman this morning working the front desk and looking at all those discontent guests. We fled this morning. Staying at Cova down the road now - great place! Same price. I have written hotwire and asked them to remove a star from the hotelrating. If it had one star and costed 70 bucks it would be an ok solution for young travellers. Ohhh yeah ...the internet worked fine.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-14"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Will stay again", "text": "I am a frequent visitor to San Francisco. When driving I have stayed at one of the motor inns in the Marina District but when without a car I have stayed at many of the boutique hotels near Union Square. I discovered this hotel while walking the area some time ago but this was my first experience staying there. Believe me when I say that this is the best of the boutique hotels in the Union Square area, particilarly at this price. We were only there for one night and I have to say it was a very positive experience. As others have said, the rooms are clean and nicely appointed. We stayed in a twin room, in the back, on the sixth floor. It was a little dark, but we heard no noise. We had a tub in our bathroom (which had a window.) There were two closets and although the room was small, we were not uncomfortable. We sat up at the bar and had some grest wine, appetizers and salads at Fino's. (Lovely female bartender the night we were there.) You can walk to most places in the city - we even walked to Coit Tower (and one of us is 62!) and public transportation is easily available. I believe that pick up from both SF and Oakland Airports can be arranged through the hotel. Our only negatives were that my daughter needed to pay for her DSL connection and that the radiator in our room was VERY noisy. We eventually just turned it off. The hotel was happy to help us with printing out our boarding passes (Southwest) for our flights. I will definitely be a repeat visitor to this hotel and to Fino's.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-11-29"}

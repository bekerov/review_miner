{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Combination of reviews", "text": "Pros: - Great location- Reasonably priced for a NYC hotel- Small &amp; Quiet Hotel- Next to anything you need (but that is NYC for you)-Nicely decorated hotelCons: - Staff was unfriendly, I saw plenty of guests just standing there while the staff was on the phone making a personal phone call guests were constantly being ignored it was very rude. Other guests would give up and walk away because staff would not even stay at front desk. Seems like the hotel needs to train staff to be more polite and also put more than one person on at a time  - Rooms: Small, staircase is too tiny to move luggage on, no elevator or staff offering to help you bring luggage upstairs- &quot;Continental Breakfast&quot; is nothing more than stale bagels, muffins, and other pasteries. *Main overall thing that could make the hotel better =staff", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-04-18"}

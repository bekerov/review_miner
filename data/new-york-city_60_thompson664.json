{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Disappointed", "text": "Luxury Hotels website sold us the idea that although the Hotel was away from other bar scenes, this hotel has two very popular cool bars to enjoy. When I checked in I was excited and could not wait to try their roof top and inside bar. On our first night we were very disappointed to learn that both bars were closed for PRIVATE EVENT so we decided to go somewhere else. On our second night we wanted to have a drink in the afternoon before getting ready for dinner and again the bars were closed til 9 pm. Well they lied after having dinner and looking forward to coming back to our hotel to enjoy the facilities, the inside bar was supposed to be closed for a PRIVATE EVENT until 12:30. We waited in the lobby until 1:30 am and they would not allow us in. I found it very insulting to be paying top dollar for a hotel whose premises are closed for other events. One of their employees told us that they frequently rent the bars to a local company that books events for them. In conclusion, the hotel was very nice but if the only available part of the hotel is my room, I rather go somewhere else.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-01"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Ideal hotel for families", "text": "The Argonaut is a great place to stay for families touring San Francisco because it is a clean and hospitable hotel in a child-friendly part of town. The hotel has a nice Maritime Museum inside, and the Cannery with restaurants and Norman's ice cream are literally right outside your window. The cable car turn around, Hyde Street Pier (my kids loved this!), Ghiradelli Square, Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf are all within a few blocks walk. Starbucks is at the back of the building, and Walgreen's and Trader Joe's are about a 4 to 5 block walk. We even walked to the Exploratorium ( this museum is a MUST DO for kids), which is a fairly level and beautiful several mile walk.  We chose the Argonaut because of its location, and for the fact that we wanted an upscale hotel without all the stuffiness. The hotel's decor is fun and playful. The rooms at the Argonaut are spacious and clean, plus the beds are uber comfy. Our room faced out into the Cannery courtyard, and at night we could listen to the featured outdoor live entertainment as we settled into bed. We considered this a plus, as we were so wiped out at the end of the day and our beds were so comfortable, not much would have kept us awake. The staff is friendly and helpful, although except for the doormen, not quite at the level found at most 4-star hotels. We paid a nightly rate of about 60% of the rack rate, and I think that was a good price for this hotel. The Argonaut gave me my money's worth and is definitely the best hotel on Fisherman's Wharf.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-30"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Location great staff great place!", "text": "My wife and I traveled from Michigan to spend a weekend in Chicago for some Christmas shopping and R&amp;R. We have previously stayed at the James, Hyatt Regency, and the Hilton. This was our first stay at the Amalfi and we will surely be back. It is rather small and unasumming, but easy to find on Kinzie, directly across the street from Harry Carreys. The doorman and bellhop were extremely helpful and friendly. The check-in was quick and painless. The experience planner was just that, she had answers to all of our questions and was eager to please. She most certainly went above and beyond what we have experienced with other concierge services at other hotels. The room was nothing extraordinary. It was clean and spacious. The kingbed was nice and comfy with lots of pillows. The bathroom was a typical hotel bathroom except for the 2 showerheads and Aveda bath products. We did not have any noisy neighbors but the ice machine sure cranked out some db's when guests were filling their icebuckets.One of the highlights of the hotel is the complimentary happy hour each evening from 5:30-7:00pm. The snacks and top-shelf drinks were a great way to wind-down as well as to prime the pump for a fun evening on the city. The continental breakfast was also a wonderful way to get your energy for a long day on Michigan Ave. The views are not very desirable, but we didn't really visit for the Amalfi for the view. Check-out in the morning was quick and as painless as the check-in, I had forgotten about the $34.00 per night valet parking and had spent almost all of our cash. I did tip the doorman and valet, but probably not as much as they were used to.Our overall experience at this hotel was wonderful and I hope that we have the opportunity to visit again. We would highly recommend this hotel to our traveling friends", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-12-10"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Got stuck in the elevator", "text": "We got stuck in the elevator, and the management didn't seem to care. When we tried to talk to the manager on duty Julian gave us another person to call when we called it we didn't get anyone, it was always busy. So we called back down to speak with the general manager about this problem and Julian tried to brush it off, after requesting to speak with the general manager he never got back to us. Julian even went as far as to lie to us and say it has never happened, but later when he was pushed about the problem he admitted it does happen often. They made it seem like it was our fault their elevator isn't working correctly, the elevator should be shut down. So be careful, you can only have 4 people in it (a sign would be nice). Also, when we checked in they made it sound like we were being upgraded to a suite, the problem is we clearly paid for a room with 4 adults but ended up with a room with one bed and a sofa bed. The sofa bed was not comfortable at all! We ended up paying around 119 a night, which is so not worth it. When we got back to our room the next day the maid had forgot to make the sofa bed up which was clearly pulled out and used. The rooms are also tacky! It has a tropical theme painted around the ceiling. We also had a lovely view of a net, I have no clue what the net was for. The one thing this hotel almost has going for it is location. At night down some streets it can be pretty scary, but it is pretty close to a nice area. It isn't in a nice area, but it is close to one. If you like this area try another hotel, there are many around it. We used tripadvisor to book this room from the reviews, but when we got there it all went wrong.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-31"}

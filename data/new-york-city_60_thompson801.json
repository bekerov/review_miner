{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Pricey but great.", "text": "I rented a jr. suite for a saturday night as a surprise for my girlfriends birthday. The location was perfect, a block away from dinner and the bar we went to. The room was not huge, but it was big enough to have about 6-8 people back to after the bar(with some furniture rearanged). The bed was great! The bathroom was nice, seperate tub, but wasnt anything too special. Overall my experience was great, and would recomend it to anyone looking for a great hotel in Soho, not afraid to spend a little money.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-02-11"}

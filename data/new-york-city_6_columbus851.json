{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "NIce Change of Pace", "text": "I usually stay at Marriott or other chain hotels, pricelined this one and wasnt sure what i was goin to get. I booked the hotel thru Priceline for $120/night. Hoping to get an upgrade. Standard room is a full size bed, 175sq ft. room. I called them up and they upgrade me for $60 more to a King Superior, usually $350/nite.The hotel has a great staff and quite accomodating. The location is not on Columbus Circle, but on 58th st. You walk out the door and Columbus Circle is less than a minute walk across the street. Overall it is a nice place, rooms little small, but you pay for location.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-04"}

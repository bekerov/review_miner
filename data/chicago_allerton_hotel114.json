{"city": "chicago", "title": "Best location.", "text": "We've always wanted to visit Chicago and booked a 4 night stay through Travelocity. On your site, I had read reviews on this hotel and decided to try it out. We stayed in a Junior Suite , which was very spacious and comfortible. The entire staff was very helpful in providing us with good advise on transportation around town. I would definitely stay here again.If you are sensitive to mosquitoes, do not open the window. We wanted some fresh air and found that mosquitoes abound at this time of the year. I mentioned this to the staff and they immediately sent housekeeping to spray the window area.The Allerton is perfectly situated on the Mircle Mile and close to the El train, buses, and cabs. It's quite easy to take the Blue Line train from O'Hara airport to Clark and catch a cab to the hotel. We also bought a 3 day transit pass and explored the city easily.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-08"}

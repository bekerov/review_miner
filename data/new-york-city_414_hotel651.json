{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Good value for money", "text": "This hotel is good value for money in a convenient location especially for restaurants and the theatre district. The rooms are well furnished, well decorated and clean with excellent bathrooms but accessed by a narrow staircase. The entrance lobby is rather worn but don't be put off! The 'serve yourself' breakfast was good and the staff are very helpful - especially Mike.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-10-14"}

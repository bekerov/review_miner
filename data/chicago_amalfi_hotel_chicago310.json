{"city": "chicago", "title": "A Gem My new favorite!", "text": "First, let me say that I have no connections with the Amalfi. I don't work there, know any one that works there, or have any other reason for writing this except to let others know what a great place this is. The hotel is very conveniently located, in nice walking distance to many restaurants, shopping locations, and entertainment. The lobby is rather small, but attractive, and that is the last thing you notice once you see the terrific smiles on the faces of the staff greeting you. The beds are comfy and the rooms quite clean and nicely decorated. The morning breakfast set on each floor is terrific! The evening cocktails and snacks are a real plus in a city where cocktails can be quite expensive. One of the biggest pluses is the courtesy of the staff. I've stayed a lot of places where the staff has been cordial and competent, but this place takes the cake. The staff actually seem genuinely glad to see you. I actually think the really like their jobs!I'll stay here again many times. This is a gem of a property, priced right and with nice freebies - breakfast, cocktails, wireless internet, and dvd check-out. It's a real find, but please...ssshhhh...don't tell anyone. I want to make sure I have a room for my next trip!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-19"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Excellent value", "text": "Stayed for almost a week on a visit to NYC. Considering the ludicrous prices of Manhattan hotels, this is a real find .... on a quiet street (my room looked out onto the even quieter courtyard), smart, small, with good sized bathroom. Pleasant simple help-yourself breakfasts in the morning, free (one computer) internet in lobby, very easy to get everywhere - walking distance to theatres and restaurants, and close to 42nd and 50th street subway stops. A real haven to come back to at the end of the sight-seeing day. Discreet and helpful service. Only tiny fault was that the reading lights in the room were weak. But overall highly recommended.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-15"}

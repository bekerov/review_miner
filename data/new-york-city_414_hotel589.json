The price fit my budget which is hard to find in NYC. My daughter described the room as very feng shui. It was very clean and offered all the necessities. The pillows were very comfortable and the service was great. I didn't realize when I booked the room that they offered a continental breakfast in the morning so that was a nice surprise. All the staff were friendly and helpful. The location was very convenient. We had wanted to stay somewhere that gave us a NYC feel without being too big and commercial. At the 414 we definitely achieved that goal and we can't wait to go again.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-04-21"}

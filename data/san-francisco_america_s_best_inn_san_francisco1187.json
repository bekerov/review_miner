{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Hidden Gem", "text": "Who knew such an inexpensive quaint little motel would be tucked blocks from Fisherman's Wharf? What we got for $70 a night: clean comfortable bed (better than some high-priced hotels), bus stops on the corner, free off-street parking, free wireless Internet, microwave and refrigerator. Staff was friendly and helpful. An adequate continental breakfast of pastries and fruit was enough to get you going. I would have preferred a coffee maker in the room instead of in the lobby. Even though it is only 3 stories, there was a working elevator. As we were checking out, my husband pointed out that we had a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. I thought he was joking, but a section was visible from the 3rd floor balcony! We had not seen it before because of the ever-present fog.I highly recommend this motel. We stayed 4 nights here for what one night would cost at Fisherman's Wharf.", "hotel": "america_s_best_inn_san_francisco", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-18"}

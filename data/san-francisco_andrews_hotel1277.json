{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great charming hotel", "text": "Location is convenient to BART, cable cars, Union Square and Chinatown. Charming, historic little hotel with friendly staff. The rooms are small, but very clean, comfortable and cozy! Tasteful furnishings, very comfy bed! Continental breakfast placed on each floor -- just throw on a robe or come out in your jammies and get a yummy breakfast of juice, coffee or tea, fresh fruit and a great selection of baked goods to take back to your room. Super convenient! Had dinner one night in the restaurant downstairs -- a hidden find that was absolutely delicious! The Andrews Hotel on Post Street is a wonderful, affordable gem in San Francisco!", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-06"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Excellent location", "text": "Excellent location, really convenient to Union Square (two blocks) and all the cable car lines for easy transport. Neighbourhood felt very safe at all hours. Staff very friendly and helpful. Our room was very small and had views to the brick wall next door but was comfortable and cosy nonetheless. Breakfast is a selection that you can take back to your room, or out with you for the day if you prefer- pastries and fresh fruit and coffee.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-19"}

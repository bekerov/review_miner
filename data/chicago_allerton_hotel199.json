{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Stay", "text": "As this is an old hotel, there are a number of areas that are smaller than newer hotels and that is a part of its charm. We had a suite on the 22nd floor with views on three sides of the building. Everything worked well, the waits for the elevators were short, room service was quick and good, and the facility was very clean.

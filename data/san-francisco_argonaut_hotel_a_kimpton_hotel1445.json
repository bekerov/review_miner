{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great hotel and location... if you are lucky with your room", "text": "We just stayed at this very friendly and comfortable hotel in SF with my family. This hotel is clean and very well decorated. Our only (big) problem was that our room, on the second floor, was street level at the back of the hotel. Every morning we enjoyed the dustbin cleaners and their truck at 5.30 + street noise. We can definitely recommend this hotel, but just make sure you get a room at a higher level and not at the back of the building. Otherwise the staff is great and very kid's friendly.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-11"}

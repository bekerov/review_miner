{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Very pleasant!", "text": "We just returned from a 5 day stay at 60 Thompson and we loved it ! Our deluxe king room was quite spacious, nicely furnished and had an incredibly comfortable bed. Staff was extremely friendly, helpful and efficient. We had dinner twice in our room and once at Kittichai and the dishes were always delicious. All in all, everything was perfect. But when I pay 480 $/night, this is also what I expect. 60 Thompson is a really great place to stay downtown (better than the Mercer where we stayed last year).", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-10-18"}

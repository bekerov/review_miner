{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Location", "text": "Myself &amp; boyfriend stayed here for 4 nights including NYE. Overall it is a great hotel. Not the most luxurious hotel but it had all you would need for a city break hotel. We had a top floor room which is not a problem if you are young &amp; resonably fit. The staff were friendly &amp; they even sent up a bottle of red wine on arrival which we thought was a nice touch.The breakfast was great (muffins, croissants, cereals, juices) although there was never quite enough seating room but we were happy to bring ours to our room.The hotel is in a great location, quiet street near Restaurant row &amp; close enough to TImes Square. We only used the subway once.We will definitely consider this hotel when we are next in New York.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-01-04"}

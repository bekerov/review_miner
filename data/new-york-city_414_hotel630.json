{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Hidden Gem in N.Y.C.", "text": "Spent one night at the 414 during an overnight trip to N.Y.C. Room was immaculate -- &quot;spotless&quot; would not be an overstatement! Much more spacious than I expected. Lobby was being prepared for remodelling -- so it didn't offer a very good first impression, but I'm certain it will be better than adequate when remodelling is complete. Staff was friendly, accommodating and very patient with my multiple requests for directions. Excellent location! Only a couple-minute stroll to Times Square, Theater District and Restaurant Row. Fair priced for such a quality, mid-town hotel. Will definitely stay here again -- and would highly recommend it based on location (convenient!), price and cleanliness.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-07"}

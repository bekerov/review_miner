{"city": "chicago", "title": "Happy Anniversary at the Amalfi", "text": "We stayed one night at the Amalfi to celebrate our anniversary. Hotel lobby is very minimalist, easy check-in. Room is small but has nice touches...books on shelf, CDs, nice roomy bathroom and loved the double-headed shower and Aveda products. Bed was comfy. Continental breakfast was very nice, croissants, muffins, breads, fruit, etc. We would stay there again.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-29"}

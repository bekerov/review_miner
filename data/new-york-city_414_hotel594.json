{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Hotel - Great Prices - Great Staff - Nice Room", "text": "This is a great friendly little boutique hotel in a fab. location in MidTown near the Theatre District and Rest. Row. We stayed only one night but it was very nice. Mike is extremely knowledgeable and very friendly/helpful. We recommend this cute place to anyone looking for great location, nice people and good size room with nice amenities. Breakfast in the morning is a nice added touch with good coffee and bagels, etc. I'll stay again when in NYC and will recommend to friends and family. Oh, the big screen TV in our room was a nice touch too. My only negative feedback is that there are no elevators/lift for luggage and dragging 3 heavy bags up 2 flights was a little tough.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-03-18"}

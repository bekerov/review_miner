Breakfast does not exist. the receptionist was rude.And when we thought things could not get worse, our car was broken into by a thief.We had a great loss and no assistance from the hotel. The receptionist just kept saying that they had no responsibility for the parked cars.No one apologized or offered any compensation for what happened.We lost almost the whole day solving the problem..We were not even warned about the burglary of the car. Almost 10% of our vacation was lost because the parking lot does not have a simple camera. Take a look about crimes in San Francisco? Why they don't have cameras?", "hotel": "america_s_best_inn_san_francisco", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-25"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "fantastic home base with a European feel", "text": "My husband &amp; I completely enjoyed this hotel as it met with what was expected.Yes as other reviews and the person that recommended this hotel to me said - the rooms are small and the bathrooms are really small. It is an old building. If I am recalling correctly it was a bathhouse at one point in its history.The location is fantastic. A few blocks off of Union Square and cable car lines. Buses right out front that are 10 to 15 minutes to the Ferry Building. It was very easy to get anywhere we planned to go. It is in a slightly noisy area which doesn't bother us but may be a it much for some.Cleanliness - Mostly very clean but it is about time for a deep cleaning. Dust build up here &amp; there and the building has the distinct old building smell. Staff - Friendly and helpful. Sometimes they didn't give us the correct info though.(ie: sending us to a Tix place on Union Square to buy our transit passes on a Monday and it is closed on Mondays). Lots of maps and guidebook/tour info available. The sum of this being: For the price you cant beat it if you can let a few little things go.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-07"}

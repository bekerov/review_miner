{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Nice hotel very close to the Theatre District", "text": "Stayed here for 8 days in early Feb. Very nice location - walking distance of 2-3 blocks to theatres. Also Times Square and the Blue line are in short walking distance.Rooms are of a good size, nicely decorated and we found the rooms very clean and housekeeping kept the rooms nice throughout our stay. Large safe in the room. Adequate storage space. Large flat screen TV in the room. Comfortable bed - it is 2 singles though. Bathroom was OK. The shower did not have much water pressure or heat but was adequate. Not enough hot water for a bath. Can get a bit noisy - our room was facing the front and in the morning, the traffic can be noisy - but I suspect that this is true for most places in NY. Bring your earplugs - we did and we slept ok.Breakfast was included - and was laid out in the small kitchen on the ground floor. No tea-making facilities in the room but you can use the kitchen anytime which was fine. Lots of eating places around the hotel and you are spoilt for choice.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-02-25"}

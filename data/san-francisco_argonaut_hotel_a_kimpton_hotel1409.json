Yes it has tacky bits but the centre get's a bit oppressive. Fisherman's wharf is a much more pleasent living env. The hotel covers all the bases. It's a bit tacky in some ways too but expensice tacky and you don't feel nickel and dimed. I'd stay there again but I wouldn't rave about it.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-16"}

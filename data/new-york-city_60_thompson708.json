{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "A cool and ultra trendy place to stay", "text": "I stay here regularly on business. I have to say that I always have an excellent experience. The staff have always been extremely helpful and friendly, nothing seems to be too much trouble. The restaurant is fantastic and the food is delicious. Room service is always prompt and on time and the roof top bar is a cool place to entertain with fantastic views of Manhattan. I find the rooms more spacious than others I have stayed in and the beds are one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in! Overall it's probably one of the best hotels I stay in and I am extremely fussy when it comes to accommodation!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-09-15"}

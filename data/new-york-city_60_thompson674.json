The restaurant is incredible. The room was a little worn out (stains on some of the furniture, kind of dirty pillows on the bed, and beaten up fabric on the couch). But the room (a Deluxe King) was tastefully decorated and large for NYC. I would definitely return.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-02-01"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Worst Hotel Ever!!!!", "text": "This is absolutely the worst place ever!! The restaurant was not open for dinner, no concierge, front desk agents looked inexperienced. The manager on duty was very rude and didn't seem like he cared to help me. Tall, African-American guy was very short when I asked questions. Elevators are small and slow and rooms are small and has a mold like smell. Hotel looks pretty but thats about it. The so-called business center is not a real business center. You can not fax or print any documents. When you go to the front desk complain you can tell this is something that they hear everyday so its of no surprise to them. Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-21"}

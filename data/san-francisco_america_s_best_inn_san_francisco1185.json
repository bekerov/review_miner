{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Not recommended", "text": "I felt I needed to post this review to warn others that this motel is not very clean( among other things) especially room 215. I stayed one night in 215. I awoke in the morning to see ROACHES crawling out of the vents in the microwave, they were also on the wall. I don't even want to think about where else they were crawling while I was asleep. This is just one thing. When I arrived, having reserved 2 roooms 4 months prior, the girl at the front desk had knowledge of only one room being held. I had reserved 2 rooms for 4 days and had luckly made arrangements for rooms next to each other for the 2nd day as my mother and I were at opposite ends of the motel. I was able the get out of the roach room.. Number 215 also had a door key system that did not work, locked me out of the room every time I closed the door, I had to go to the front desk 3 times to have them reprogram my key. The room was so dark I could hardly see in the bathroom. The toilet overflowed, which must happpen frequently as there was a plunged next to the toilet. The shower leaked onto the floor and flooded out the bathroom, I had to used all the towels to clean the floor. The girl at the front desk during the day could absolutely care less about customer service, even when told of the roaches in the room. There is a very nice and helpful man at the desk in the evening the only good thing about the motel. I left a note at the front desk regarding all of the above but have no way of knowing if anyone ever saw it or even cared.", "hotel": "america_s_best_inn_san_francisco", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-24"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "I've been back already - lovely but affordable boutique hotel in great location", "text": "We stayed here on our first trip to New York three years ago and loved it - so when we found out a friend was getting married in New York we know we'd go back, and took friends with us.The location is perfect - just a couple of blocks walk to Grand Central Station, and the main shopping streets - it's so central we walked pretty much everywhere the whole trip.The staff are very helpful and there's a great funky but relaxed vibe to the hotel - and it smells amazing from the moment you walk in the door!The rooms aren't huge but they are well done with all the facilities - and this is New York so for the price they were ideal.Little touches are fab too - a tray of goodies (which you do pay for but much better than the average mini-bar snacks, and lots of New York books to help you make the most of your time. They'll even print out your boarding pass for you if you complete a short form, and there's a complimentary wine reception for new arrivals every evening.Apart from the usual attractions - a couple of others we really enjoyed - The Campbell Apartment just inside Grand Central Station isn't cheap but has a great vibe and worth a visit for drinks. The food at Michael Jordan's restaurant - also in the station - was surprisingly good, and don't miss out on Junior's cheesecake. But one of my absolute favourites was Cafe Wha? out in Greenwich Village - a fantastic night out if you liike live music, but do book ahead if you're in a group and check out the website first to see if it's your thing - best night we had in New York by far.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-19"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great value and would stay here again.", "text": "I recently spent two nights at Andrews Hotel with a friend. I'm used to chain hotels and thought this was a refreshing change. Yes, our room was tiny, but we spent little to no time in the actual room while we were in San Fran. The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance from Union Square, Chinatown, cable car and lots of other tourist type things/places (we even walked back to the hotel from Fisherman's Wharf). We had a standard room with a queen bed and managed to squeeze in a roll-out bed (packed it up during the day for more room). Breakfast was plentiful each morning, even at 8:30 a.m. The room was clean and we were supplied with fresh towels and toiletries each day. Valet parking is one of the cheapest around, $25 for 24 hours (unlimited in and out). Just make sure that you let them know 20-30 minutes in advance when you want the car. If you do not have a car, they told me at the front desk that you can arrange transportation to or from the airport for $12, somthing I will take advantage of next time. Not once did we move the car while we were in San Fran.I highly recommend Fino, the Italian restaurant off of the lobby. The first night we lounged in the lobby with drinks from Fino's bar and the second night we managed to have dinner there. Over the past year, I have eaten at Fino's twice and have never been disappointed. The prices are reasonable and the service is exceptional. They keep busy so reservations are recommend. Also, the bartender is great at making drinks and good conversation (he needs a raise!).", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-10-28"}

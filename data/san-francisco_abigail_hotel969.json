{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "unexpected surprise", "text": "After reading the reviews I was expecting the worst... the hotel is comfortable, large rooms and friendly staff. Free breakfast was included which is a lot more than what we got in other much more expensive hotels we stayed in in California. The area which the hotel is in is indeed ghetto, drug dealers and users but they keep themselves to themselves. A bus or taxi is advisable to the centre as it is a distance to the main attractions. It is a budget hotel and doesn't claim to be anything else, worth the money and if you are travelling it is ideal. San Fran is really awesome ( least place we were looking forward to whilst travelling California) however it proved to be amazing. We cycled golden gate bridge, went to Alcatraz, countless bars and restaurants and lombard road is neat too! If you are staying for a short time then the Abigail is fine and a normal breakfast of toast and juice is what most people desire for breakfast not stacks of pancakes and fried food. Well done Abigail for getting this right! Oh and there is free internet in the lobby.", "hotel": "abigail_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-21"}

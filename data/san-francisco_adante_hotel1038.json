{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Faulty Towers comes to Frisco", "text": "Good location but that's where the fun stops. Horrible check-in experience.....after 14 hours direct from Sydney the clerk refused to give us a room at 10:30 am because checkin starts at 3:00 pm, even though he agreed that rooms were available. $20 cash fixed that little problem. Worst thing was the breakfast. No actual dining room so guests have to crowd around an alcove off the lobby with their crummy rations of self-serve white bread toast with jam and tea, coffee, juice etc. (Then walk downtown and pay to have a real breakfast). No bar, Internet cafe, business facilities....or anything really. Just the room.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-01-12"}

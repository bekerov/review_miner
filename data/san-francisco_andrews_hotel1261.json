{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "The best secret in San Francisco!", "text": "The Andrews Hotel was amazing. We were right in the heart of Union Square and could walk to everything. The location made our stay in San Franciso seem effortless. Additionally, all the extra special touches made me feel like I was at a resort. The staff was very friendly. Our room was gorgeous and very clean. The attached restaurant and bar was the perfect place for an early appetizer and drink with lots of friendly advise from the bartender. My FAVORITE part was the breakfast waiting for us on each floor when we got up. I will be back soon!", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-10"}

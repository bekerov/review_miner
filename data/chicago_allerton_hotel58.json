{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Location Would Stay Again", "text": "A friend and I stayed here for 3 nights. As it was our first time in Chicago, we wanted something with easy access to shopping, lots of things to do and places to eat. The Allerton did not disappoint.We were able to walk to almost everything we wanted to do (parks, navy pier, shopping, restaurants, etc). We did have to take a bus to Bucktown, but the stop was right near the hotel.The staff were friendly, though we didn't interact with them too much.The room was in good condition and clean, but the layout was awkward, not allowing the person on the far side of the bed much room to walk to their side (less than a foot). As two girls, we didn't mind sharing one bed, but it was hard to get around without disturbing one an other.We were very impressed with the fitness center. There are several cardio machines (bikes, elliptical, 4 treadmills) each with their own tv screen and weight machines/ free weights. It was clean and there were always plenty of towels. It is bright and airy and wasn't overly crowded when we were there.The restaurant in the hotel was ok. It had good food, but not really a good place to have a 'night out.'Overall, we would happily stay at the Allerton again; It was the best value for us.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-11"}

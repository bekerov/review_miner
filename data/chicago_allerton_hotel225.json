{"city": "chicago", "title": "Overall a Great Experience!", "text": "We were awarded this hotel through one of our regular Priceline bids. We've had our share of horrible experiences when bidding for hotels, and after reading some of the reviews on this site, we were prepared for the worst. We were pleasantly suprised, however...Overall, staff was very polite-- even the front desk. Yes, they tried to upsell us a suite upon checkin (which we gently refused). But when we were done, we had a &quot;handicapped&quot; non-smoking room with a king bed and a rollaway for our daughter. An ideal situation for our family of 3..We had plenty of towels, the room was clean, and we never had to wait long for an elevator (and the hotel was completely booked).Yes, the elevators are small, the halls are narrow, and the rooms can be tiny (judging from the fire escape plan [hint-- ask for a handicap room!]). But overall this was a great experience, especially for the price we paid.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-02-21"}

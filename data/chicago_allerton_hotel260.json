{"city": "chicago", "title": "Old World Hotel in Great Location", "text": "This was a great hotel for a single person. I stayed three nights and was able to check-in a little early (1:30 PM). Pretty good work-out room (wish there were more free weights) Small guest room, but it didn't matter since I was alone. It was clean, tastefully decorated and laid out well--good pillow, sheets and mattress, etc. Friendly staff, Great location--easy walk to shops, transit, etc. Well worth the low price I received on an on-line reservation site.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-08-17"}

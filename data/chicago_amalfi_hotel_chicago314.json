We wanted to stay some place special but also had a budget! We were excited to find out that their normal price of rooms were priced down in January, which then allowed us to be able to afford to stay there! We stayed there just one night but loved our stay! Our bed was absolutely beautiful! I loved the covers! The only drawback to our room was a misunderstanding with the type of room we received. I thought we were getting the room with the rounded wall with windows when they said king corner, but it was a corner room with each sides of the windows facing another building just feet away. So there was NO view from our room. Also, they lobby was very small so there was not that many places to walk around in the hotel. I LOVED their complimentary Amalfitini's they served. One of the best drinks i have ever had! Very yummy! I would definitely stay here again!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-03-28"}

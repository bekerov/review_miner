{"city": "chicago", "title": "Crowne Plaza...breath of fresh air!", "text": "After staying at the Best Western River North the previous night, the CP was a breath of fresh air!Although there were major conferences going on in the city and everyone was sold out, CP managed to get us in the day of our request. Although my room was small and quaint, I loved the room decoration. The bed was awesome. The bathroom was a fresh difference from the standard restrooms in other hotels. I also loved the personal welcome message that I got on my room's voicemail when I checked in!My only complaint is that I was in the room directly across from the elevator. The hall noise and the elevator &quot;ding&quot; was a little annoying, but I was able to sleep through it. The sleep CD is a cute additive, but a little worthless as the person talking got on my nerves. My last complaint is that they &quot;inadvertantly&quot; charged me for an item in the bar in the room. But after notifying the front desk, they removed the charge.Overall, I would stay at the CP again. I was in a wonderful location cute, clean and quaint.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-10-06"}

I am very happy to announce this was a wonderful trip from the beginning to the end, the room was very clean, staff were wonderful, location was unbeatable, some have made comments regarding the size of these rooms they are a bit small however certainly very cozy and comfy.. and lets face it anyways who goes to Chicago to spend all the time in the hotel room??", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-14"}

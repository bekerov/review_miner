{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "First Rate Service", "text": "We had stayed at another hotel in this chain during our trip and was impressed. We found an America's Best Value Inn on our GPS and it looked to be in a good location and has off street parking. We made our reservation through America's Best Value Inn's main phone number. This one is within walking distance to The Presidio and MANY bars and restaurants. The rate was very low considering the location but what impressed us the most was the service. I have never received that level of service from a budget hotel/motel. Their staff will go to great lengths to make sure the guests are comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in San Francisco.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-05"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Hotel!", "text": "We had a great experience at the Amalfi Hotel! It's in a great location - walking distance to Michigan Ave, lots of restaurants, and the House of Blues. The hotel room was very clean and had a nice modern decor. The complimentary continental breakfast on each floor was very convenient. Coffees and pastrys but good. They also had a gym on our floor that was clean with new equipment. Didn't deal with the staff much but when we did they were very helpful. Great overall experience!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-25"}

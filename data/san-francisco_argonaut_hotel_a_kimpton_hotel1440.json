It was well worth the small upcharge as the breakfast was wonderful, the parking would have been expensive, and the cable car pass was for 3 days. The hotel is in a great location and everyone was helpful and nice. Can't wait to get back!!!", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-25"}

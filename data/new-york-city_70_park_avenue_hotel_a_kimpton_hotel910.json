{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Excellent Location Comfortable and Friendly Hotel", "text": "A perfect hotel for a girls shopping trip to the Big Apple. Located a short walk from Lord &amp; Taylor and Macys and a few blocks from the subway at Grand Central Station with the express trains to Uptown and Downtown Manhattan. The rooms were a good size (by New York standards) with comfortable beds. The staff were friendly and helpful and check-in/check-out was quick and straightforward. The rate was excellent and included a more than adequate buffet style breakfast. I would happily stay at this hotel again.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-14"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Place and value", "text": "Me and 2 friends flew in on the 7th and the front desk checked us in very fast and was curteous. The palce used to be called the globe hostel and the only sign showing that it was americas best value inn was a banner in the window, but that wasnt a problem. We got to our room and I was very surprised to how clean it was. Ive stayed in a hostel before and it was 2 beds, a bathroom and wasnt the cleanest place, but this room however was more like a standard hotel, 2 beds nicely made, a clean floor, a drawer and mirror and even a table and chair. the bathroom also had marble flooring and a hair dryer. There was even daily maid service coming in to clean the room and bathroom daily which is something you dont even find in motels alot of times. the front desk was friendly in calling cabs for us when needed and there werent any homeless people until a few blocks down, and at night just to get into the main doors you needed to swipe a room key to get in for added protection. The only downside was the ac wasnt hooked up yet becuase of remodeling but with the cool temps in SF you could open the windows and itd be just fine.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_suites_soma", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-09-17"}

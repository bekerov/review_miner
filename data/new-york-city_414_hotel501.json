{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Perfect Little Spot", "text": "I stayed at Hotel 414 a year ago and this past Valentine's Day. This place is a great little hide away and in a perfect location. A block away from tons of great restaurants, time square and hid away on a quiet block. The beds were super comfortable and the rooms were spotless. A great spread was put out for breakfast too. One of my favorite places to stay when visiting the city.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-03-03"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "A Chicago Gem", "text": "At first, I was a bit skeptical to book with the Allerton. I'm a person who feels most comfortable staying at branded hotels like Hilton or Intercontinental. After a stay at the Allerton, I found myself exceptionally pleased with my choice to give them a try.I booked my hotel directly through their 1-800 number after looking at the rates on their website and Expedia. The receptionist was extremely pleasant and helpful. She addressed all of my concerns, including the fact that I was only 18. I asked if there would any problems checking in without a 21 year old adult and she assured me the hotel would permit me to check in.Upon arriving at the hotel, I was met with friendly and professional staff. Check-in was prompt and I was very pleased with my room.I was traveling on a budget; so booked their mini-room. I believe they call it their &quot;Petite Classic&quot;. I, traveling by myself, found the room to be more than accommodating and large enough for myself.The room had a very up-to-date look, although I remember the bed being a bit stiff. The bathroom was small, but had a very neat shower!Overall, the room was fairly small but large enough for one person. No doubt it was one of the best rooms in downtown Chicago for the price I paid.Would definitely stay again!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-03"}

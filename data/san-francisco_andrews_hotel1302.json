{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Andrews Hotel Rocks", "text": "Charming Victorian era hotel, old but cute &amp; sparklin' clean. We stayed in an oval room with 2 bay windows, totally cool! Coffee &amp; fruit &amp; pastries on every floor every morning. The location is excellent for shopping. Bus service is readily available &amp; the Tix booth where you purchase Muni Passes for public transportation is 3 blocks away. No nearby BART service, though. The staff here is super nice &amp; helpful &amp; you can get a free glass of wine in the hotel bar once a day! Plus there's a liquor store right on the corner. Also, they show free outdoor movies 3 blocks away at Union Square at night. There is noise at night like any other city, but if yr young &amp;/or go out at night often, this is not a big deal. This place is well worth the price. Many good things within walking distance.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-17"}

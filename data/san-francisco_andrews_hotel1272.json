{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Definitely Noisy...", "text": "My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights... and it's a good thing we get a long well since the room was so small we were practically on top of each other. Also, we had a front room on hte corner and the traffic from the street was so loud at night. There is no air conditioning and the heat was turned up so high (you can not control your own) we had to have the windows open to breathe. The benefit, however, is that the price is great for the location. Also a light breakfast is included, as are the sodas and water in the mini fridge. I would stay here again, I would just ask for a back room and bring my own ear plugs!", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-20"}

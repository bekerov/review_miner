{"city": "chicago", "title": "Extremely pleased", "text": "I booked two rooms at the Amalfi from a Travel Zoo special. I was really leary as to what I was getting because the price was $119 per night. To our pleasant surprise both couples of us were quite impressed and pleased. The rooms were above average, well decorated, and pleasant to be in while you were there. We received a continental breakfast each morning and a manager's reception (cocktails and appetizers) each night. The manager's reception is quite a treat! Great drinks and food. Above all the hotel staff was extremely helpful and very customer friendly. The hotel is in close walking distance to the theater district, magnificient mile, merchandise mart, etc. All of us would be happy to stay at the Amalfi again.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-05-02"}

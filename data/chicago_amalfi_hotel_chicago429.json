{"city": "chicago", "title": "Excellent Boutique Accommodations", "text": "After researching thoroughly (Tripadvisor, Gayot, etc.) we decided the Amalfi rated a try for our first visit to Chicago. We had a wonderful stay, enjoying our room and the general atmosphere, which approximated a small European Hotel.Pro: Attactive, good-sized room with very comfortable bed and functional/ tastefully contemporary furnishings and accessories; large bathroom with nice little vanity area, including separate makeup mirror and bench; CD's in room, and all the quality amenities one needs. Very quiet setting, no loud/drunken conventioners, sports fans, etc.; obliging staff with good attitude (even brought a microwave to our room so my wife could make popcorn, at no charge). Spotless carpeting, etc. -- well cared for facility. Included continental breakfast and happy hours are nice quality and plentiful in quantity and choice. Within 5 - 15 minute walk of museums, river tours, excellent restaurants, live theater and jazz club.Con: Only first 6 stories of building are hotel, so no amazing views (we stayed in room 615 and got a pretty decent partial city view. No complaints, just be aware that a top floor view is not like one you'll get in some of the more pricey Michigan Ave. hotels. The happy hour lounge is rather cramped and noisy, so take your drinks to your room; no protein for breakfast, so pick up some yogurt if you need it (plenty of room in the minibar fridge.Unless you must have the &quot;extras&quot; of a big hotel (room service, restaurant, bar, etc.), or be right on Michigan Avenue, the Amalfi represents an excellent choice at a very moderate price. Expect to pay $75-100/night for anything equal in the Loop/Magnificent Mile area", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-06-10"}

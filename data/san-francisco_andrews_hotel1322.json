{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Cute boutique hotel", "text": "Nicely decorated hotel with lots of character. Felt very old San Francisco. The continental breakfast had a good variety, and the hotel also had nice touches like 24 hour coffee/tea service in the lobby. Rooms are indeed small, a little dark, and the bathrooms have not been modernized. I did not find it to be noisy even though my room was next to the elevator. The hotel put a $150 hold on my credit card (for a one night stay with a room rate of $99), which I was not expecting.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-03"}

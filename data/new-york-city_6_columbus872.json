{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Sweet 6-Spot", "text": "I was pleasantly surprised by 6 Columbus. Having stayed a week at Soho sister hotel, Sixty Thomson last year, I was pretty reluctant to repeat the experience. But my sister and the attractive price point convinced me otherwise. And I'm glad for that.The location is super, right on Columbus circle, near every convenience imaginable. Unfortunately, most taxis had a hard time finding it, for some reason.I booked the basic room and expected something tiny, this being NYC. But I was happy to find that although small, it was spacious and had clever little storage spaces like underbed drawers. The service is pleasantly unpretentious, understated, accomodating and most imptly, inobtrusive. Loved the Fresh toiletries. Could have more of a variety though. Too basic.And although there's the jumpin' -- and delicious -- Blue Ribbon Sushi bar in the lobby, it was never too noisy, scene-y or happening, thankfully.I ate at the Blue Ribbon every day - sometimes twice a day - and once when i had some bad fish and became ill, they waived my bill and gave me a $100 voucher, with min fuss. Can't blame them completely though, traveller's diarrhea may have played some part in this.The room service breakfast, though was overpriced and horrible (burnt cold toast). Otherwise, a sweet little spot. I'm there next time I'm in Manhattan.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-12"}

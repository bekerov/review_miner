{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Loved it! Spacious studio suite friendly staff great location...", "text": "We were staying for four nights and booked on QuikBooks - it worked out at 4 nights for the price of 3, average of $224 per night. We stayed in a studio suite on the 11th floor. Friends of ours stayed on the 10th floor in a studio suite.The suite was very spacious with lots . Bathroom had a great walk-in shower with great water pressure, and also a bath which I personally love. An oddity about the bathroom is clear glass in the window. Room had a wooden floor which I liked and the bed was large and comfortable, and there was lots of storage space. On the downside, air conditioning was noisy at times, and sound travelled from other rooms. The suite on the 10th floor was more compact, didn't have the walk-in shower, but had a fantastic balcony space (although a chair or two would have been nice). Given the hot weather, this was a great place to relax, especially in the evening.The bar and restaurant wasn't to my taste as I'm not into Japanese food - but it was busy most nights and the food looked like a work of art. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful to us at all times although they seemed a little clueless with how to deal with a guest that had her handbag stolen from the Starbucks next door - there was no advice on hand and the distraught guest had to try to think of all the things that had to be done herself from ringing the consultate to cancelling the credit cards to informing the police.Internet at $10 per day is expensive especially since it was wireless and there is no free access in the lobby.Overall, we loved it and we'd certainly stay there again.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-29"}

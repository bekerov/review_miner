{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Little Hotel!!!!", "text": "We stayed at this hotel from 28/1 to 4/2 and this was my first trip to New York. I read the reviews here beforehand and was in two minds, but have to say that I was more than happy with this little place!The rooms were clean, stylish and well presented, with nice beds and a good shower. The hotel consists of two buidlings and we were in the rear, so had virtually no noise from traffic or activity in the streets. The hotel is excellent for getting to broadway, times square and getting around the city (fantastic for getting to intrepid if you are an anarac like me!). The breakfast was good each morning. The staff were all very friendly and helpful (yes even the one who appeared surly!!), Mike and Andrew were great, and I feel we had excellent customer service whilst there. I thoroughly recommed this hotel and would stay there again!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-02-06"}

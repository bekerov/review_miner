{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Perfect location", "text": "We stayed at 60 Thompson for a short week last summer and thoroughly enjoyed it. Having never stayed at the hotel before, we picked it based on a friends suggestions and its location as we knew we were spending most of our time in the area.The location is one of the best considering the low number of hotels around Soho. the hotel itself was nice - stylish and modern. Staff was helpful, the room was cozy but not very big. I knew this beforehand so it wasn't a shock or anything. The view on a higher floor was amazing and sounds from the street were surprisingly quiet, don't know how they'd be on a lower level?My only complaint is what others have mentioned, plumping is oddly loud, I could hear rather clearly when someone flushed a toilet in the room above. also the room door was very poorly sealed (annoyingly common in hotels) so sound from the hallway was pretty loud. luckily there wasn't a lot of movement there.Overall it was a very pleasant stay, unfortunately we didn't have time to check the restaurant for other than breakfast which was good though, and the decor there was really cool.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-01-09"}

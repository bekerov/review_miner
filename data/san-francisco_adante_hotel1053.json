{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Horrible - don't stay here", "text": "The service at this hotel was horrible!! The room was sweltering; we were told they were experiencing problems with their heating, and it could not be turned down. It was 85 degrees inside, 50 degrees outside, but the window only opened 6 inches. When we woke up the next morning, there was no hot water. Again, we were told there was a problem and they were working on it. After waiting over 2 hours for the problem to be fixed we ended up taking cold showers. When we checked out I asked if they were offering a discounted rate because of the problems. I was told they could credit us $3 for the Evian water we drank, but that was all. Of all the places to stay in SF, Don't stay here!!!!!!!", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-03-05"}

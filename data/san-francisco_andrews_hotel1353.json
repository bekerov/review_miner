{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great little hotel", "text": "Really enjoyed our 3 night stay in our 'cosy double' room which was spacious enough and quiet being at the back of the hotel.The staff (especially Oscar) were very friendly and helpful. Free hot drinks in Reception was a nice touch as was the fantastic breakfast served outside our room.The location was very convenient, being only a few blocks from Union Square.Would stay again and definately recommend for great value, high standard and location.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-05-16"}

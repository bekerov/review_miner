{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "We loved this hotel in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf.", "text": "We spent 5 days in San Franscisco for Spring Break. This hotel is located right across from the cable car stop and were able to ride downtime very easily. Plus, we were able to see all of the attractions at Fisherman's Wharf. I think it's the best hotel on the Wharf. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean with plenty of hot water. The only complaint would be that the queen sized beds were not the typical queen size but a little smaller. With 3 out of 4 of us being 6 feet or over, it was a little tight. If you go to the Wharf, you have to try the corn/crab crowder in the Argonaut resturant; it's incredible.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-08"}

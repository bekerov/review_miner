{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "A good budget hotel.", "text": "This is a value/budget(2 star) facility. Knowing this in advance will let you have reasonable expectations. The neighborhood is not the best-it's somewhat run down with numerous homeless people on the streets (in all 5 days we were there we were not bothered/harassed by the homeles @ all). if you're from a big city or have vacationed in a big city, you will not feel unsafe. It's about a 10 minute walk from the Civic Center BART station located on Market and 8th(also the location of numerous public transportation routes as well). The hotel rooms are basic, clean, and a bit cramped. The Wi-Fi access/speed is great, the television programming needs improvement since there are very few channels available. The breakfast provided consists of muffins, coffee, and juice. Most restaurants are about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. If you're looking for a no frills, budget hotel, you'll be satisifed. However, if you are accustomed to 3-5 star facilities this is not the hotel for you.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_suites_soma", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-08"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Overall excellence", "text": "Overall excellence. Stayed for 5 nights and was never disappointed. The location was central to everything from south of the river to the north, which made for easy walking. Friendly and helpful staff, quiet rooms, out-of-the-ordinary free continental breakfast and evening cocktail reception (with top shelf liquor). This hotel occupies the lower 6 floors of a 12 story building. The bedrooms are average size but the bathrooms are large with a double-headed shower and plenty of counter space. Very minor considerations: only provide 2 towels per day but give extra when asked; no exhaust fan in the bathrooms; had to jiggle the handle of the toilet to keep it from running; no mirror in the bedroom. The back of the hotel is the quietest but only the top 2 floors have a view --- the others face a brick wall. Would definitely stay here again.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-08-04"}

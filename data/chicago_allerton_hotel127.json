{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great location", "text": "I loved the location right on the magnificient mile, but the roomswere too small for two people and so was the bathroom, we were in a room with a motor going at all times, we don't know what it was but it was loud and made it hard to sleep. The beds are not very comfortable either. We were with a tour group and the elevators took a long time to get to you, so we spent a lot of time waiting for elevators which during the rentavation weren't supposed to be renovated, they dated way back one of the bellman told us. One of our group broke her zipper on her suitcase and one of the bellmen went to K-Marts and got her a new one, so the service was excellent there. They are presently under going some construction so that wasalso a problems for us. It's a nice hotel totherwise and I would probably wouldn't stay there again because of the noisy room and the slow elevators.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-14"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Clean friendly hotel. Good deal for the money.", "text": "Stayed here for three nights in a Queen Deluxe room. Hotel itself is starting to look a little tired around the edges, but is overall well maintained. The room was on the small side, but clean, and comprehensively appointed. Bed was very comfortable. Room itself seemed to be overlooking some kind of ventilation shaft and there was constant hum from the air-conditioners down below (even from 9th floor) so if you are particularly noise sensitive be aware of these rooms (though perhaps not as bad as rooms looking onto street). Staff were all friendly and helpful. Wine tastings in the evening are a nice touch, and the ambience overall is casual and friendly. Location is good - comfortable walking distance to Times Square and Central Park. I would stay here again.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-13"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Wonderful Stay", "text": "We loved our stay at the Allerton. After reading reviews we decided on the Allerton. We went for the junior suite and it was perfect! We had a siting room and a bedroom with plenty of space. You just can't beat the location--right in the heart of the Magnificent Mile. You can walk to just about every attraction. We would definitely stay here again. Just a little tidbit of info--go to the hotel website--there are sometimes specials that are not advertised.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-15"}

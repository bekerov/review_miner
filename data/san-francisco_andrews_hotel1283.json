{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Cozy hotel in a great location", "text": "I used to live in San Francisco, and now visit every year. This hotel will be my base from now on: it's not fancy, but is in a superb location, is priced well, and the staff is very nice. I love the buffet continental breakfast on every floor; it's so convenient to pop out and get a cup of coffee to drink while getting ready to go out for the day. Many good restaurants in the neighborhood, including one right in the hotel.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-06"}

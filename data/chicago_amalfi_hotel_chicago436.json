{"city": "chicago", "title": "In the middle of everything!", "text": "Stayed April 19-22. Staff was great, location even better. Two girls late 20s and it was perfect. You were within walking distance of everything (Michigan Ave, Navy Pier, Division St) and a quick cab got us over to Wicker Park. Bed was comfortable and room was clean. The continental breakfast on each floor was great as you could walk over in your pajamas, grab something, and go right back to bed. Perfect when you are out all night and don't want to sleep your day away.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-04-23"}

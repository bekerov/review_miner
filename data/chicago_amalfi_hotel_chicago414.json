{"city": "chicago", "title": "A classy choice I'd return to", "text": "There are SOO many options of hotels to choose from in Chicago, especially in the epicenter of the Loop and Michigan Avenue. The Amalfi hotel located on Kinzie street a block from the Chicago River and next door to the Trump tower (that is STILL under construction at the time of this posting) is in a perfect starting-out-point for a nice walk to explore the urban landscape. Millennium park, Michigan Avenue, the Loop, its all within an easy walking distance from the Amalfi. Being an independently owned hotel, the Amalfi is in a position to show off it's individuality. The rooms are impeccable, a daily complimentary cocktail lounge opens on one of the floors at 5:30pm. Serving hors d'oeuvres and their signature Amalfi-tini, amongst soothing mood music, this is a must see before heading out for a night on the town. The rooms are plush, luxurious, and comfortable. The bathrooms are fully stocked with Aveda-brand products. I couldn't find anything I didn't like about this property; I'd recommend it to anyone. Probably not the most kid-friendly, but for couples it's def. a must.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-02"}

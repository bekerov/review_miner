{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great deal", "text": "Great location! We were visiting our daughter and her apartment was a block and a half away. The hotel is also an easy walking distance from Times Square, Broadway, Central Park and the river. Our room was very comfortable and overlooked a wierd old church built in the 1870's. The bathroom was a nice size, particularly for NYC, with lots of counter space. The room was decorated with large old photos of NY. The street is really cool and quiet, we were awakened by the sound of horse carts clip-clopping down the street. Breakfast until 10 means not having to get up early. We had a little refrigerator in our room. It was inexpensive for NYC. My only complaint was how dark the stairway was (no elevator). Dark carpet, dark walls, no lights. I could hardly see the first step. We plan to stay here again.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-26"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Nice Stay", "text": "After reading the advice found on this site, I had requested a room on a higher floor. Upon check in we were given a room on the second floor with the possibility of a room change the next day. The room's bathroom was very small and not easy to use. It was loud at night with the room facing the alley. The next day we did get a different room on the top floor, and it made a great difference. The bathroom was much bigger, and the noise was minimal. Also, the maid showed us what the &quot;best&quot; room in the hotel looked like, and it was not much nicer than the other rooms. Overall, for the price, the hotel worked for us and we would only stay again if we were guaranteed a room on the upper floors.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-03-05"}

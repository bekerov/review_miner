{"city": "chicago", "title": "Slippage Has Begun", "text": "This is still a nice hotel and the staff is great, but there are a few warts on this hotel that weren't there a few years ago.One of the best features used to be the morning breakfast. The quality of this breakfast has fallen so far that during our last stay we opted for breakfast out. Unappealing breads and danish and high sugar content juices were the extent of the spread. It appears that they have greatly cut back the breakfast to save money.The rooms are still fine (and one of very few hotels in downtown Chicago where you can book a room with 2 queen size beds). Clean. Good sized. Nice bathrooms.Parking is $48 a night. You may want to self park for less because oncce your parked you won't need your car until you leave. Everything is close or a short cab ride.This used to be my favorite hotel in Chicago but they just don't pay attention to the details the way they used to. Nevertheless, a good place to stay.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-21"}

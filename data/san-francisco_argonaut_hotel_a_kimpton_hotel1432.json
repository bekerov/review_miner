{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Nice hotel shame about the food", "text": "As others have said... perfectly situated, excellent staff, and fantastic view if you happen to get a Bay View or Gate View room. We'd booked Kimpton's &quot;Breakfast for $1 more&quot; offer, which meant the Blue Mermaid restaurant next door. We tried dinner the first night, and found that the service was inattentive, slow, and (more than once) incorrect. One of the fish dishes was served so undercooked it was practically raw, which is just dangerous - and this was &quot;fish and chips&quot;, not sushi. The cooked breakfasts were cold by the time our waiter brought them over, and more than once only bore a passing resemblance to our order.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-09"}

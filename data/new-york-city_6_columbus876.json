{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Average NY hotel", "text": "I stayed at 6 Columbus for 3 nights in May. The hotel is fine for the price I paid, but there are better hotels for similar prices (the Hudson for example). Rooms are tiny as expected, location is great at Columbus Circle and near the park. The room was pretty clean (except for a strange goo on the bedside table!) and the front desk service was acceptable.If you can get a good deal ($200 for a queen room) I would recommend it if you don't need top notch service. If paying regular price, look elsewhere.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-02"}

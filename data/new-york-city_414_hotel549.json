{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Tiny rooms but clean and great location and price.", "text": "My husband and I stayed here for one night in March to see a show and have dinner in the city without having to drive home afterwards. We had a ground floor room # 101- which was tiny- even by NYC standards, but it was very clean and the large flat screen tv on the wall was a fun touch. It was very noisy, we heard people walking through the hallway all night- the hotel needs to do something to deaden the sounds in the lobby. Carpet or rugs- or something on the walls maybe??? The location is great to take in dinner and a show all within walking distance. The price was great- $ 160 per night- and it included continental breakfast, coffee all night, cereal, mini bagels, and juices. Not a bad place for a night but I would be claustrophic in the room if I had to stay much longer. There wasn't even room for a chair to sit on instead on on the bed. I probably wouldn't go there again, but it was fun for a night.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-03-11"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Beautiful hotel killer restaurant dazed service", "text": "IF you can get a good rate here, 60 is your best boutique bet in NYC. Even the tiny rooms are on the stylish relatively comfy side, but I've been upgraded a few times, and the suites are great. Lobby is cool and fun- bar's a good scene (rooftop especially) - restaurant Kittichai is one of my favorite rooms anywhere and totally delicious. You cannot beat the location- just off of bustling West Broadway, so you don't step out into the madding SoHo crowds, but close to everything. I can't say that service really exists here, but they're not nasty or snotty, just kind of dizzy and uninterested.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-01-03"}

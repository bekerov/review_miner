{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Staff/ Great Location", "text": "Unfortunately, we had to go to NYC last minute for a funeral. The staff was incredibly caring, especially Lula. We had four separate rooms which were all lovely. The sheets are amazingly soft. The decor is fabulous...watch out for the corners of the platform beds!Plenty of closet and drawer space and the water pressure in the shower was fantastic, as were the toiletries of the hotel. Starbucks is just next door so a Latte is never far away. Whole Foods is in a great mall across the street. Everything we needed was within walking distance, including Central Park. All in all, its a bargain. I would highly recommend 6 Columbus.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-21"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "The Andrews is Great!", "text": "Just wanted to share our experience as we rely on those we read here when looking for hotels. We spent 4 nights at the Andrews. It was a perfect choice for us and it certainly met our expectations. As other reviews indicate the standard rooms are small and the bathrooms smaller. Besides after spending all day exploring the city, you are ready to collapse and let me tell you, you we did so in the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in! The Andrews was very quaint and reminds us of a European hotel. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Finos was outstanding. We ate there 3 of the 4 nights it was so good. We are planning our next trip to San Francisco and we will be staying at the Andrews again.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-09-07"}

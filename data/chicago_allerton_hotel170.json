{"city": "chicago", "title": "Fabulous Location...but a little \"tired\"", "text": "The location was great! There is no question about it! HOWEVER, we got a bit of a deal &quot;on-line&quot; and had we paid full price, the hotel would been a disappointment. On the &quot;plus&quot; side, the staff was friendly and helpful and it was kind of cool to stay in a historic Chicago hotel. The gym also had great views and a wide variety of machines. Our room was small, which wasn't that big of a deal (since we were out touring), although the bathroom counters were not adequate in terms of space. The room smelled of some sort of cleaner and the towel allotment was bare minimum. We could see how in its day, it must have been glamourous, but its only half-way-there by today's standards. You might want to entertain other options in the area.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-11"}

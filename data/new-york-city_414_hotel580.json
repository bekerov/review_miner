{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Gem in NYC", "text": "I stayed in NYC with my sister May 4-8. We did extensive research online and readmany, many different reviews. We found that the 414 Hotel had everything we were looking for, including a fantastic price of 159/weekday, 169/weekend. The rooms were very clean and modern. The large flat screen TV mounted to the wall, the refrigerator in the room, modern furnishings, free internet access in lobby, friendly staff, free continental breakfast that kept us full till noon every day, and the serene courtyard are just a few reasons why we will return to this hotel. We felt very safe as two women in our thirtys walking around the neighborhood. We went to see &quot;Three Days of Rain&quot; during our stay and we walked about 5 minutes to get to this theater, although cabs are readily available from the hotel entrance. NYC is such an energetic, vibrant city to visit, and the 414 met all of our needs. I would recommend booking early, (21 rooms go quickly) and I would request a room in the back building on the lower floor. (the building closer to the street may be noisier). The hotel has 4 floors and no elevator, this was a minor inconvenience and we preferred the lower room rate to carrying our luggage up a few stairs. (we came to New York prepared to walk and the extra money we saved with the room rate we went shopping with.) We will look forward to our next visit at the 414!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-06-05"}

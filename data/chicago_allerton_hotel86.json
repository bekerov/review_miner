Worst hotel I have stayed at in 3 years", "text": "I was very disappointed in the hotel and shocked that they have maintained their 3 1/2 star rating. I can actually handle the small room as the location is great and even can get by that it really isn't renovated. But, the unprofessional and un-friendly staff is inexcusable to me. I arrived in from a long day of traveling @ 11:30pm. There was not any water for purchase in the room so I went to the front desk and bar and was told there was no chance in getting a bottle of water in the hotel but that there was a grocery store a couple of blocks away. Being a women walking around in Chicago @ midnight is not the smartest thing to do. So I decided to make do. As I was heading to the elevator I asked the bellman if he knew of any bottled water in the hotel. He proceeded to say &quot;no&quot; and stuck his hand out to say &quot;but I can get you one if you pay me&quot;. This blew me away!!!!! Midnight and the shady bellman wants some under the table cash for a bottle of water. Will never stay here again.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-27"}

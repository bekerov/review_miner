{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Mixed", "text": "I have to differ with most of the reviews I've read. Maybe it's a generation thing. Yes, the staff are fine: very helpful. And the place is clean. But: why is it that so many &quot;4 star&quot; hotels in NYC give you less than a Holiday Inn and charge you much more money? No coffee in the room. No free WiFi. No ironing board/iron. Three big marks against the place in my book. And the NYC-tiny rooms. Not as bad as the Hudson down the street, but still: no place to sit and relax, read a book, etc. And the decor. Yikes! Dark blue hallways; elevator walls covered in faux black fur with industrial metal accents. I felt like I was entering a dungeon. But it's a fabulous location. The bed was OK, the soaps were nice, and it was quiet. But then again, I booked with Priceline, so my window faced an brick wall, not the street.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-02-03"}

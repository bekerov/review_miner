{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Stay was very unpleasant", "text": "When we booked online we requested 2 single beds, this was completely ignored and there was no apology given. Room decor was shocking. The bedding had cigarette burns. Room was hot &amp; stuffy with no air con. Windows had no fly screens. Wireless internet was hopeless most of the time. Unable to watch the news due to the fact the television cut out due to 'energy saving'. Advertised as Continental Breakfast included. this was a joke. You were required to cook your own toast in the foyer and there was nowhere to sit down to eat it. Hotel had one small lift for over 70 rooms. We were on the 6th floor and most times we used the stairs. Would never never use this hotel again", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-13"}

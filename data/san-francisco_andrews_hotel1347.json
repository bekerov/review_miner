{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Andrews in SFO Always our first choice", "text": "We always stay at the Andrews when in San Francisco. Why? Location in the theatre district is also within walking distance of Union Square, Bart, Cable Cars, a variety of ethnic restaurants, China town, Grace Cathedral. In addition, the Andrews houses FINO, a superb Italian restaurant with great food in abundance at good prices, fine wines and best bread we've ever had in a restaurant. We love the wait staff and even more the complimentary glass of wine each evening. Breakfast is generous and included in the room price. The rooms are small, but quaintly furnished and with the usual amenities of expensive hotels. Adjacent to the hotel is a one-day laundry, grocery stores, sandwich shops, etc. I might also mention the complimentary Ghiradella chocolate bar placed in the room.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-27"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Small hotel in a great location", "text": "The best thing about this hotel is its location and that everything is as advertised on their website (always a worry in these times of cunning web design). Neat rooms, breakfast outside in the corridor + tea, coffee, cold water all day in the lobby. The staff were polite and helfpul - what more could we ask for?!All in all my two teenagers and I spent a happy three nights there - launching off every morning to explore SF and being just a few minutes from Union Square was perfect.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-15"}

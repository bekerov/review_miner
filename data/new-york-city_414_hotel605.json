A real gem", "text": "What a gem!First of all: the location, really near to Times Square, says it all.Apart from that, my room was very spacious, tidy, very well kept and with a huge king-size bed.There is a big drawback, however: there is no lift, and so being on the 4th floor could be quite a drag.The hall is very tiny as well, but U got free Internet, and the staff is more than friendly and helpful.I was there last august, and got a good deal, 150$ per night, so I guess it's one of the best values for money U can get in NY", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-12-26"}

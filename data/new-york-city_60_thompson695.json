{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Couldn't use the bar !", "text": "60 Thompson in NYC is an attractive hotel and the staff are stylish and attentive. However when I stayed there in December one thing amazed me...for three of my four nights in the hotel the bar was closed to residents as it had been hired out for private parties. If you wanted a drink you either had to sit in the lobby or the tiny bar of the restaurant downstairs.&quot;Completing the whole Thompson experience are the beautiful Thom bar and A60&quot;...clearly this was an experience that i did not get. When you are paying the best part of $700 per night you want to be able to drink in the bar. To be told that it is owned by a seperate company is pathetic...if you dont control it, take it off your website. To add insult to injury they sent a bottle of average champagne to my room...of course, in Soho that is exactly where you want to drink...in a room on your own!!!!In synopsis, what a crap experience for your guests...worst of all there was no warning and when friends joined me for a drink i looked like a tit in that i could not drink in my own hotel.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-01-16"}

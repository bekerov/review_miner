{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Hotel", "text": "The Andrews Hotel made our NYs celebrations special as our previous hotel messed up our booking we turned to them as they are (a) cheap and (b) I had read good reviews on here! Our stay was great and for what you pay this is a top hotel with a great location for exploring the city and of course, its shops! The staff were really helpful and even upgraded us for free. The room are either a King with two large bay windows and a more compact bathroom, or a Queen room with one window and a larger bathroom. We opted for the larger room and smaller bathroom and it was great. The building itself shares the great architecture that many of San Franciscos hotels offer and the old style lift was fun....the breakfast is a basic continental affair laid up in the hallway every morning, sufficiant but if you're into your full breakfasts then maybe not your cup of tea.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-01-13"}

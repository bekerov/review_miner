{"city": "chicago", "title": "Sneaky But Nice...", "text": "After working with our travel agent we settled on the Allerton for the price and location. I read SEVERAL reviews that mentioned the parking and the &quot;hidden&quot; fee of $51 per night. Also that the elevators and rooms were SMALL. Everything was indeed the way I read. I opted to find my own parking and after a complaint of the condition of the room we were upgraded to a double that was more than sufficient. If that was their basic room I would have been happy at the onset. The biggest thing to anger us is that we went to the resturant for breakfast the 2nd day there and were greeted by a waiter who poured OJ and Coffee never asking if we wanted either. When our bill arrived we noted that we had to pay $5 for each orange juice and $3 for a cup of coffee (which was FREE around the corner from 6a-11am~!!!!) Overall the hotel was ok for the price but I think I will be looking around if I travel back to Chicago.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-25"}

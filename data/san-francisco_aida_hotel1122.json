{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Filthy Worst Place I've Ever Seen", "text": "FILTHY. STRAIGHT OUT OF THE MOVIE HOSTEL. This is the worst place I've ever seen and been in. The whole building is about to collapse. Extremely old. The room had an unbearable smell. Shady receptionist. Will always find a way to charge you a lot more than what you were promised. Surrounded by homeless people, druggies, prostitutes, and XXX peep shows. The only difference between this area and ghetto downtown LA is that people are fooled and actually come to this hotel. Did not even bother to stay the night.", "hotel": "aida_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-07-31"}

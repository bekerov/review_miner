{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Small chic hotel with excellent customer service", "text": "Recently returned from a 2 night stay at 6 Columbus. Very nice, small chic hotel in a great location central to everything. Stayed in a King Deluxe room with a very comfortable bed, &quot;cool&quot; decor with a nice flat screen tv on the wall. The entire hotel including the rooms are dimly lit which gave it a hip, night club-like atmosphere. The customer service was outstanding from start to finish. The doormen always welcomed you with a pleasant greeting, front desk staff were very friendly and courteous and check in and check out was fast and smooth. The front desk and doormen/staff communicate with wireless devices. As soon as I got there by cab the doorman opened the taxi door and asked me my name and quickly alerted the front desk via the device that I had arrived and they were totally prepared for me by the time I reached them. They even had the doormen have a cab waiting for me at the precise time I checked out and walked out the front door. Very well organized operation. The only thing I didn't like was the shower. The tile wasn't that clean and the shower head didn't work that well - no tub in the room. There was no iron in the room either. Overall, I reccommend this hotel for young singles who are looking for a cool, safe place to stay at reasonable rates.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-24"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "bad neighbourhood!", "text": "The hotel is in the city but there are so many homeless people day and night, so it's not fun to walk there at alI. I didn't like the atmosphere and the reception desk people. You have to park your car (you have to pay a lot for it) in a carpark at an other hotel. To walk from your car to the hotel is horrible too. The rooms are very old and not very clean and the shared bathrooms are dirty. The next day we left the hotel to stay at a motel at Lombard street, same price but very good, clean and big. With the bus you can go everywhere! So don't stay here, I was afraid the people around Aida hotel wanted to rob me or do even worse things!", "hotel": "aida_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-01-22"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Certainly Acceptable Hotel in Chicago", "text": "I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on March 17 &amp; 18th. Due to it being St. Patrick's Day in Chicago, the hotel was very busy. Enjoyed the location, price, breakfast and nice, clean room. However, the &quot;bartender&quot; in the lounge was unwelcoming at best - perhaps the hotel mangement is unaware that this man needs to work away from customers?? It was perhaps understandable on Saturday nite, as the lounge was packed, but he was just as surly on Sunday, when the lounge was almost empty! His attitude was the only negative in an otherwise nice stay.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-03-25"}

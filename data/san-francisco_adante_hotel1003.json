{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Very good value for money for a short stay", "text": "The location of the hotel is very good - a few blocks from Union square, with lots of public transportation options nearby. There are a few homeless guys around, and it's better not to go too far down on Geary street, but the hotel itself is still in a safe area.The price is very good for such a location, and if you want to save the money for better things than a fancy room to sleep in, this is a good option.Obviously, this is not a 5-star hotel. No AC, the carpets seem and feel way too old, and in our specific room we had to figure out how to open water in the shower without tearing the tap off the wall. On the other hand, the bed was a delight, the room was painted nicely, and it was very quiet - a very important issue in the city center.And they provide a computer with free internet in the lobby. Overall, it was a very pleasant and affordable stay.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-22"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Good for one short night", "text": "We would not have chosen to stay at this hotel but the Days Inn a few doors down was remodeling and could not honor our reservation for a room with two beds. The office staff did give us a room at the same discounted AAA rate but I wonder if they got the best of the deal. The room was small and did not include a coffee maker, 'fridge, or microwave. The room and the bathroom were clean. Breakfast consisted of coffee and a prepackaged Danish. Since we checked in late and were leaving early, the room was okay for us. I would not have wanted to stay there for an extended vacation. The hotel is handy to many S.F. sites and included free parking if your vehicle is small enough for their spaces. The Day's Inn allowed us to park our extended cab pickup at their facility; otherwise we would have had to park on the street.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-15"}

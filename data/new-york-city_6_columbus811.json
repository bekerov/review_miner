{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Good hotel but.....", "text": "My husband booked this hotel in Jan 09 for my 50th birthday in Aug, he booked a queen superior &amp; also put on the booking form that it was for a &quot;special birthday&quot; and could we have a room with a nice view. When we arrived we were allocated room 79-it was the SMALLEST room I have even seen, and looking out of the very small window the only view was of a very large white soil pipe running down the middle of the window, when I challenged the porter as to what grade of room it was, he said it was a &quot;pod&quot; room, we explained that we had booked a queen superior he suddenly changed his mind and said yes it was a queen superior! We did get moved to a better room after complaining to the front desk (still no nice view and certainly no up grade, as lots of other people seemed to get in the reviews) In the 4 days we were there only 1 of the 2 elevators worked &amp; we were on the 7th floor. Apart from the above the hotel is in a great location and was clean &amp; tidy. We felt the hotel was all style &amp; no substance, it all looks very classy on the web site.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-07"}

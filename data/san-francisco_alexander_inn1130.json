We didn't have the problems with bugs but the rooms were small and the web site is really deceiving! My husband and I took our 12 year old daughter with us and we didn't want her out past dark when we were on the way back from dinner! There are flop houses on one side and a club on the other that played music of course until after 2:00am. My husband and I are smokers and had to hang outside the hotel to smoke and you should have seen all of the drunk underage children spilling out of the club and the freaks coming out of the flop houses! I decided that the smoke was not worth going outside for! The elevator still felt like it was going to drop so we decided to use the stairs where we noticed paint peeling and smelled smoke from the elevator. The staff sat behind a desk with a baseball bat which made us question being there in the first place. If there had not been a no refunds policy we would have left...and don't get me going on the continental breakfast!! NEVER AGAIN!", "hotel": "alexander_inn", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-25"}

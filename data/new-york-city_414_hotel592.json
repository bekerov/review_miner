{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "414 Hotel exceeded expecations", "text": "Stayed at the 414 Hotel on 46th street off 9th avenue from 3/30/06 through 4/2/06 and enjoyed the botique atmosphere, outstanding rooms with 42 inch TV's on the wall and the knowledgeable neighborhood advice from Mike at the front desk. The location is superb with a wealth of resturants and pubs only meters away. The rooms are well furnished, comfortable and larger than many highers priced hotels and the excellent continental breakfast, which can be taken in the courtyard, is an added delight. Clearly one of the best buys in the city.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-04-03"}

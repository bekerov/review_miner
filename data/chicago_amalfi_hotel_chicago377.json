{"city": "chicago", "title": "OK but not quite up to expectations", "text": "Based on the glowing reviews here I'd expected quite a lot from the Amalfi. Our stay over the Easter weekend wasn't bad, but I cant help feeling slightly deflated. Before I get on to that, a few of the good points...The location is great, one block from the river and hence walking distance from everything in the center. The restaurant across the road (the one that supplies the room service) does good steaks and has bags of character, a real asset. Free breakfast laid on outside the lifts on each floor is nice, but you do need to time your sortie just right in order to get much of a selection.On the downside, the rooms (and hotel in general) are rather tired in appearance (worn fittings and fixtures etc) and lack anything resembling character - you're clearly in a cheap concrete box, taking me right back to my days in student dorms. There's nothing actually bad here, and they are trying a few different things which is to be applauded in this world of large chains, but for me the experience wasnt really top notch.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-07"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Small space but recommended", "text": "I have stayed at this location on multiple occasions for work travel, and each experience has been positive. This is a nice location very close to Grand Central Station and within walking distance of many resturants. I personally love the wine 'happy' hour that is offered in the late afternoon. It is great to walk in from a long day at work or travel and be offered a glass of wine to relax and welcome you to the hotel. I have not eaten at the resturant, but I have had a few glasses of wine with friends, and the staff is always very nice and willing to meet your every need. I would highly recommed this hotel for work or leisure, especially if traveling without children.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-08"}

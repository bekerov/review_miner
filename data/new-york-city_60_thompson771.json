{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Bizarre service", "text": "Stayed for 3 night here in a King Deluxe in February 2005. First some positives. Fantastic location in the heart of soho. Round the corner from great shops, cafes and restaurants. The hotel's design is great, and our room was very nice. We got a special offer through quikbook, and paid $250 per night, which was good value in my view. We ate in the bar one night, and the food was very good. Ate from the thai tapas menu, and although pricey, the food was very nice. Despite the quality of the room, and the hotel in general, the staff are really quite unique. My first experience of the 60's staff was when the bell boy carried our bags to our room. I tipped him $10, he said thanks, and he left. So far so good. Within ten minutes, i had reason to go downstairs, where I bumped into the guy holding my $10. I said &quot;how are you&quot;? to which he replied by looking at me as if I had ------ in his cornflakes. You may think he didn't hear me, but I can assure you, he was right next to me, and heard loud and clear. The point I'm trying to make, is that the staff at this hotel have so much attitude, it's unreal. The guys on the door show little interest in opening doors. The reception staff can't even bring themselves to raise their eyes to speak to you, prefering to conduct a conversation whist looking at their computer. It's strange this, as they were quick to respond to other requests. For example I asked for an adoptor to charge my phone and they were very prompt. It seems to be only in face to face discussions, that they disgrace themselves.A genuinely bizarre experience dealing with the staff here. A great hotel, hence the high review mark, but try to enjoy it without interacting with the staff.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-02-21"}

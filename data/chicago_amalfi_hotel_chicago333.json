{"city": "chicago", "title": "Amalfi Awesome!!", "text": "We loved the Amalfi. The beds were comfy and the Aveda hair products were great. The staff always greated us and welcomed us back. It's in a great location to walk around and see the sites of Chicago. We woke up to a continental breakfast each morning and the newspaper waiting outside our door. Each evening the Rafello lounge had cocktails and a wonderful antipasto repast to enjoy as we met other hotel guests. Thank you Amalfi. You made our first visit to Chicago spectacular.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-14"}

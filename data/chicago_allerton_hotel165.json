{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great location great concierge service", "text": "Got a pretty good rate of 190 for a conference. Hotel was old school but remodeled and nice, clean. Rooms were a bit small, but not a problem for us. Location was wonderful...close to everything and the el. Concierge was very very helpful....recommended a fine steak house for dinner and called over to secure us a table. Porters/bellhops were totally on it, called in taxis, etc. Was pleased for the price. Would stay again, but would probably not pay over 225.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-21"}

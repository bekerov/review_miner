{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Fantastic!!", "text": "I have recently returned from a four night stay at 70 Park Avenue, and what a wonderful stay it was. The staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The room was beautifully decorated, and the beds a dream to sleep in. We had an amazing view of the Empire State Building from our bedroom window. The Hotel is conveniently located in a quiet area, but within easy walking distance to Fifth Ave, Broadway and only two blocks from Grand Central Station which made it really easy for us to get around.The Wine Tasting, every evening from 5-6pm was a good idea and the attached bar had happy hour from 5-7pm. There is a Starbucks one block away that opened at 6am, great for those early mornings, and Scottys Diner on 39th and Lexington does wonderful breakfast.Overall a fantastic stay and I will be returning as soon as I can!", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-17"}

It wears its history proudly, and the marble steps that used to go to the saltwater baths on the second floor are still there. Be sure to ask the staff (especially the amazing Oscar) about the place's past: it was the only building in the area to survive the Great Shake and Bake, and so the owner sold hot showers to the survivors and rescue workers. The 19th C elevator is also a real trip. Sure, rooms are a bit small, as are all urban hotel rooms, but the fresh paint and carpeting have updated the place without turning it into a HoJos. The cleaning staff are the best--polite, fast, and thorough. And don't miss the little baguettes they put in the hall in the morning for continental breakfast.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-04-04"}

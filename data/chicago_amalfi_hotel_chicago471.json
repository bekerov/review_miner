{"city": "chicago", "title": "Loved the Amalfi!", "text": "The Amalfi Hotel was great, and I agree with the other postings, hotel was much better than many 4 or 5 star Hotels I have been to. The key things that made the Amalfi better:- best continental breakfast (located on each floor, so you don't have to put shoes on or get dressed, you can stay in pj's)- Manager's reception - free cocktails/appetizers each night - great way to meet other travellers and relax- Local jazz cds, books and magazine were much appreciated, I feel asleep to Chicago jazz everynight- Bed - was fantastic, so comfortable- Bathroom - stocked with Aveda products and had a double head shower. Plus, all the staff are really friendly and very helpful. I would definately recommend the hotel and I would return. Book this hotel, you won't regret it, great location, amenities and service!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-05-18"}

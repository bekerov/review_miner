{"city": "chicago", "title": "Not Bad Not Great", "text": "My husband and I do a lot of traveling to Chicago on business, and we usually stay at The Conrad Hilton or the InterContinental, but they were both booked solid, so we tried the Allerton for the first time.We were in a Jr King Suite, so we did not have a problem with the room being small or a low ceiling, which is a good thing since my husband is 6'4&quot;. The elevators and hallways in the hotel are super tiny, and it's true that you have to change elevators to get to street level, but that didn't bother us.The room itself was quite large and comfortable, but it was definitely showing some wear. As other reviews have mentioned, the shades were missing from the windows, and the curtains were dingy and torn in some places. (I bought clothespins from a drugstore to keep the curtains shut because after reading reviews here, I didn't want to bother asking maintenance to fix them.)The staff was very courteous and friendly, especially the maid for our room. We did not have the nightmare experience that some other reviewers had, but we will probably stick to The Conrad as our first choice of hotels in Chicago.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-19"}

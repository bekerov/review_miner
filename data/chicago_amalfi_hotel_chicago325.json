{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Small Hotel", "text": "The Amalfi is a great hotel. The only reason I gave it an above average rating and not Excellent is because of our limited interaction with the staff. The lobby is apparently undergoing a renovation because we checked in in a small room right outside the elevators. Check-in was quick and easy and the staff was very helpful though. The room was nice but not over the top. We got a great rate through Expedia by staying 3 nights so it was definitely worth it. The quality of food for breakfast was good and the nightly free drinks in the lounge were a nice touch.  The location was perfect for us. We were within walking distance to shopping, great restaurants, and the theaters. If it was too cold to walk, it was a very cheap cab ride.  Overall, I was very impressed with this hotel and would recommend it to any of my friends.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-05"}

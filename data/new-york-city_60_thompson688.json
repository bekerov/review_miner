The location is great but other aspects meant it was really VERY expensive for what it was.Staff excellent and friendly at all times, especially the bellhops.I chose the delux room and it was large with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was nice and the loo had a fierce and loud flush. Accoustically you could hear noises from the other rooms as well as the people in the hall.I would recommend it but i am not sure for that money, that I would return. The area is great !", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-05"}

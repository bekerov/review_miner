{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Excellent location decent hotel", "text": "Spent 1 night at 70 Park Avenue in October - overall stay was great, especially for the price paid (&lt;$200).We were arriving and departing from Grand Central - so the location was perfect (literally 2-3 blocks away). Lobby was relatively small - and included a small seating area, and tables with laptops to use (free wifi was also available throughout the hotel). We missed the afternoon wine reception, but seemed like a nice touch. Check-in was quick and easy, desk staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was on the 2nd floor facing the street, at the end of the hallway. Street noise was not an issue at all. I'm assuming this wasn't one of the better rooms (2nd floor), but it was completely acceptable.Room was decent size for NYC - certainly not cramped. Bathroom was very large and clean. Bed was comfortable. Huge plasma screen TV and ipod dock were nice. Overall I wasn't blown away by the room, but for the amount of time we spent there it did the job - no complaints.When checking out we were asked if we wanted to store our bags at the hotel, which was great since we did not catch our train until that afternoon and weren't looking forward to carrying our bags around NYC for the day.Overall - highly recommended, especially if you're arriving/departing from Grand Central and want to stay in midtown.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-05"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Good little place", "text": "This hotel is in a good location and at a good price. The room I had was clean and well presented if a little old. If you can ignore the rather misguided pink paint effect that covers walls and all woodwork then you should be pretty pleased. Hotel staff were very helpful and advised me of the one area not to walk after dark when I checked in which was helpful being a female travelling alone. Area felt safe to walk around at night and is handy for buses out to Pacific coast, as well as acceptable walk to cable car (4 blocks). Slight drawback was the toaster setting off the fire alarm 2 out of 3 mornings! Definitely get a MUNI pass as you can save your energy on those hills!Watch out for the Scientologists in the old Transamerica Building, they lure you in with an Open House sign, but do have a quick stop at Wells Fargo Museum in the Wells Fargo Bank, if you're at all interested in the real Wild West! The Thai place on the corner up from the hotel does quick, cheap, good food.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-02-07"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great little hotel!", "text": "Stayed here for 4 nights in early January. I like this hotel a lot. For the most part, it was clean. They have free breakfast, though I was never up early enough to try it. It was quiet. Great night's sleep! I liked the room's size, very comfortable bed, and large spacious bathroom.If you want to watch tv, only a few channels work, but that was fine by me.There is no elevator so be prepared to carry your own luggage upstairs.I got a great deal for this comfortable room.Great location! Very close to the Theatre District and Time Square.Have fun!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-01-10"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "great little hotel", "text": "Found this hotel on expedia and then read reviews on tripadvisor berore booking.. Wonderful service; easy check in. Valet parking only which was a little pricy. The lobby is beautifully done and so was the room. Great toiletries by Aveda. Continental breakfast provided on each floor in the elevator lobby. Nightly cocktail hour with drink tickets provided at checkin. No complaints whatsoever. Would definitely stay again.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-22"}

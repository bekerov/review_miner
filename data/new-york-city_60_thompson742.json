{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Fantastic location restaurant.", "text": "Very luxurious, primely located hotel plum in the middle of Soho - great restaurants abound (including the one on site!) and even better shopping! Very pricey, but worth it for a splurge on a night or two - cramped rooms as is typical of that area - but modernly decorated and the service is fantastic - I pinched a nerve in my back an hour before I was due to leave the hotel and the city and the concierge made a plan faster than lightning, booked me into a nearby spa for emergency massage and called a taxi for me. Really was impressed - and if it wasnt for her, I'd have had a nightmarish 20 hour flight home! Very cool place, day of arrival Vogue was executing a fashion shoot in the foyer - you know you're in new york :)", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-10"}

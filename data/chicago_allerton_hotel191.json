{"city": "chicago", "title": "Horrible experience - will never again stay here", "text": "I stayed at the Allerton for 3 nights for a conference and had the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel. They put me on a smoking floor despite my confirmation listing a nonsmoking room. There was no shade on my window - I reported this immediately, and every day I stayed there, and yet nothing was done to cover the shade. They offered me a breakfast voucher for this and said it would be delivered to my room; however, it never showed up and I had to go to the front desk to get it. Finally, the front desk staff were extrememly rude and incompetent throughout my stay. I waited in line at one point at the front desk, and all the other guests in line were complaining about their experiences as well.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-04-14"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Small accomodations but overall nice", "text": "Awesome location for this modern, boutique hotel. Right across the street from Time Warner Center. The staff members at this hotel were fantastic - from the doormen, to the front desk - all seemed to work on the guest's behalf almost effortlessly. The room (superior queen) was fine for 2 adults but a bit small. The bathroom was modern and nice. We were on the 6th floor and our view was of the HVAC system - not surprising for NYC.The hotel was perfect for us. I would certainly stay here again and would highly recommend to my friends. I wouldn't recommend to someone expecting a large, full service (restaurants, gym, etc) hotel.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-09"}

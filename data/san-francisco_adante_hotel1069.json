{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Good deal would return for sure!", "text": "We stayed at the Adante hotel for 4 nights at the beginning of August. The place felt warm and welcoming. Staff were nice and I liked this hotel as soon as I opened the door.The room we had was on the last floor at the back and this was great because no noise was to be heard from the steet. The room size was ok, manageable for us who had two suitcases. It was clean and comfortable. And the decoration added to the ambiance!We went a couple of times to the coffee shop adjacent to the hotel to relax or simply read the papers. Charming place.The location is great even though, late at night or really early in the morning you can observe homeless people wandering around. Still, I felt safe at all time.So, great place, great value for my money. Would go back anytime!", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-09-12"}

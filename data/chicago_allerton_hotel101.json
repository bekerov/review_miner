{"city": "chicago", "title": "Loved the Allerton", "text": "My husband and I stayed in one of the classic rooms. It was small but perfect for us. We weren't spending much time in the room so didn't need/want anything more. It was clean, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was fine . We lucked out with a room that faced Michigan Avenue.We (especially I) enjoyed the boutique feel of the hotel. It reminded me of European boutique hotels we've stayed in during other vacations. We loved the fact that the hotel was right downtown with easy access to everything. Staff were courteous and helpful.We would stay here again and I've already recommended the hotel to my friends.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-19"}

I was a little hesitant to book at the Allerton based on some of the negative reviews I had read. Anyhow - got a great rate on Hotels.com and went ahead.The Allerton exceeded my expectations in every sense. The hotel is charming, my room was updated and clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. I can't recommend this hotel enough. The only, and I repeat only negative of the whole stay were the small elevators. Best of all the Allerton is right on Michigan Ave in the heart of the Miracle Mile. One block from Rush St. and all the great restaurants. Two blocks from Lake Shore Dr. and Lake Michigan. You simply can't beat the location.It's funny to read the negative reviews after staying at the Allerton. I guess some people will nitpick anything. If you're on business, or traveling with your significant other - this is a great spot to stay.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-05-05"}

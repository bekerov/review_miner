{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "well-kept secret!", "text": "We just returned from NYC; we stayed at a great little place, off the beaten path, The 414 Bed &amp; Breakfast. It is located on a side street in the theater district, a fairly quiet street. We arrived earlier than the check-in time &amp; were allowed to leave our luggage in the lobby. Our room was a pleasant surprise; we were expecting a tiny room &amp; throw-rug size bathroom but both rooms were adequate in size, the flat-screen t.v. was great, nice down pillows &amp; comforter. There is a little 'frig, a safe in the closet, a luggage rack, &amp; well furnished. The negative was the poor water pressure from the shower. It takes a while to rinse long hair. Our room was on the 4th floor which was a daily reminder of how out-of-shape one can be after a long day of sight-seeing. The courtyard was pretty &amp; breakfast of pastries, coffee &amp; juice were nice. The staff was very pleasant as well. We were very pleased &amp; will try to stay there again on return trips!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-06-19"}

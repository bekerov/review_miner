{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Not Bad", "text": "We spent 2 nights here in mid- March. Not as bad as the reviews had me expecting. The rooms are basic but fairly clean. Motel staff were very helpful; quickly providing additional pillows and a missing chair from my room(??) . Very good coffee in the motel lobby in the morning.  I would likely find a hotel more on the outskirts of the city next time.....and then use public transportation rather than renting a car. Parking is just impossible in San Francisco! Weekly or daily passes for the public systems are very affordable.", "hotel": "america_s_best_inn_san_francisco", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-03-19"}

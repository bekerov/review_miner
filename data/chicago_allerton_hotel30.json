{"city": "chicago", "title": "Tiny Room but big comfort", "text": "The Omni across the street was booked solid, so I looked across the street and saw the Allerton. So while my friends stayed at the Omni, I took a room at the Allerton. The two could not be further apart. Although my friends and I waved at each other from our rooms, the feel of the Allerton is decades away from the upscale chain Omni. The Allerton's sign at the top of the building gives a traveler a hint of what the Allerton is - the Tip Top Room used to be one of the hottest clubs during the big band era and the hotel retains much of that Art Deco feeling. It has real character. But, built for single travelers, the rooms are tiny - &quot;petite classic&quot; was the description of my room. It was bijou, but spotlessly clean, nicely laid out and with all of the upscale amenities - lcd tv, wireless internet, robe, room service, etc. The fluffy comforter on the bed was perfect for a chilly Chicago night. Despite the small room, it looked out over Michigan Avenue with great views of the Magnificent Mile. The bathroom was beautifully done with retro style tiling and fixtures (great showerhead), but there was no shelf or space for toiletries which really undermines the feeling of luxury. Still, the location can't be beat and for the money, it is a great value. My next time in Chicago will be at the Allerton", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-03"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "America's worst inn", "text": "The staff were very unhelpful and most didn't have a good grasp of English. We stayed for three nights and the second night the room wasn't cleaned, and on the day it was 'cleaned' the used polystyrene coffee cups were placed back on the coffee maker upside down complete with coffee stains. The room was filthy around the edges and under the bed. We had acquired the room at a reasonable rate and didn't expect luxuries but we did expect a clean room. However, the location was good and it had free parking and a lift. The wireless internet was useless and 'continental breakfast' was a coffee and a muffin/doughnut. Other guests were very noisy late at night/early morning. We complained again on checking out but were told by the receptionist there was nothing she could do. The person behind us in the queue to check out agreed how awful it was. I wouldn't say there again. Having spent a month in the States staying in various hotels and motels this was certainly the worst we encountered.", "hotel": "america_s_best_inn_san_francisco", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-02"}

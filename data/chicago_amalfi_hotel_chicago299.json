{"city": "chicago", "title": "Clean Quiet and Comfortable room", "text": "we just got back from the Amalfi and loved everything about it. All the staff was very personable, yet perky... not stuffy at all. The bed with 7 pillows was incredible and the double shower heads made for the best hotel shower I've come across. The breakfast served on every floor was incredible convenient and tasted incredible. We took full advantage of the Manager's Reception every night. The bartender was very skilled and the food served was awesome. The Amalfi has a great location if you're there on business or are looking for close bars open late, but you'll have to walk a bit to get to shopping. Free internet and pets allowed. Although they were 100% full while we stayed, we heard no noise from our room. No restaurant on site but Harry Carry's is across the road and all room service comes from there. Try eating as Shaw's Crab House, about a block away when you go!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-22"}

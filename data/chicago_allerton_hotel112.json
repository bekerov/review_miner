Down the elevator which are the slowest. The said we could have a king for $30.00 upgrade we agreeded and went to the room.It was a little hot in the room and we turned down the control and went out. We came back and the room was still hot. We call and they sent maintenance he worked on for any hour, and said it would be cooler, it didn;t we had to call again in total they four times and never fixed it. They needed a part they didn't have, over 400 rooms and they don't have the part that controls air temp. We were there 3 days and they would take off the $30.00 up charge for the room per day. Since I booked through Hotwire they couldn't take rooms charges off. My advice don't pick this place", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-13"}

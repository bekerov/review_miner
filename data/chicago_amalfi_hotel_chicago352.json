{"city": "chicago", "title": "Amore! The Amalfi !", "text": "Our family of 4 travels quite a bit so we've had lots of hotel &quot;experiences&quot;. The Amalfi was one of our most pleasant stays. The staff was friendly and helpful, the hotel clean, and the afternoon happy hour was divine! Each staff person we encountered seemed to enjoy their work and performed in top form. I believe this also reflects on the management - happy work environments create happy workers! Cudos to the trustworthy housekeeping staff who returned my forgotten &quot;stuff&quot;. Some of these things were vacation purchases that still had tags on. They were returned in a timely manner intact. We will see you on our next visit to your beautiful city.

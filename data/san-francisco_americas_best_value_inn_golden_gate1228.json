{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Nightmare Rip Off", "text": "8:30 on a Saturday evening in August and after having our reservations not honored at another establishment, we were stuck. This motel was the only one with a vacant sign still lit. The proprietor said that only one room was left and that it would cost us $175.00. Not having any choice other than sleeping in the car, we agreed. When my wife pulled out the credit card, she was asked to pay in cash instead, which we refused. Now about the room. There were two beds and a cabinet with a TV AND THAT WAS ALL! No tableNo chairsNo mirrorNo toilet paperNo waste basketNo cupsNo remote for the TVOne towel and wash clothThe carpets were still wet from being recently shampooed and the room smelled like cleaning products to the point of nauseousness. We had to sleep with the windows open on this very busy and noisy street. The lesson we learned - If your stuck in San Francisco with no room on a Saturday night, drive across the bridge and find an honest hotel farther north. It might be a late night, but at least you'll get some sleep and pay fair prices.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-08-27"}

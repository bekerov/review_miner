The decor is fabulous in the lobby...It's got a very young, hip vibe. (Also had great food in the restaurant--Blue ribbon.) The rooms are small w/ no view (at least for us), but that's what I expect in New York...But, all of the elements in the room were nice...great linens, a flat screen TV, fresh products in the bathroom. My only complaint might be that we were close to the elevator and I heard it in the morning.Overall, great experience. So nice that I'm sure I won't be able to afford it when the hotel is completely finished!", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-19"}

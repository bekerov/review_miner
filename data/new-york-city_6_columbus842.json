{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Practically Perfect", "text": "Spent one night with family. We had two rooms. Both were upgraded, which gave us extra space (and room to hang out together), and fantastic value. Loved the style of the decor. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the sheets were TERRIFIC, and rooms were quiet (surprising to the two of us were are ex-Manhattanites!), etc. Our only complaint, if we were to have one, was that the sofabed in one of the rooms wasn't made up, which we didn't discover until we needed it (late), which entailed a short wait, improvised bedding, and making it up ourselves. (True, the &quot;turn-down&quot; staff had been by at about 6:00, but at that point, we were using the sofa as a sofa!) If you want to be near the Upper West Side and/or Theatre District and are looking for a luxurious, stylish place to stay, you'll be happy.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-04"}

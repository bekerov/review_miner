{"city": "chicago", "title": "Highly Recommended", "text": "We stayed at the Amalfi on a Thursday, Friday and Saturday night and I can't say enough good things about it. The location is *excellent* - within walking distance of all major tourist attractions (Magnificent Mile, the Loop, river cruises, Art Institute, Cultural Center, etc.) or, failing that, access to transportation to the attraction. A block or so away to the north of the hotel on Hubbard and along State are also a selection of bars and restaurants for anyone interested in dining out and/or nightlife. The hotel itself is clean, well-appointed and the staff are courteous and professional. We'll definitely be staying at the Amalfi on future trips to Chicago.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-05-28"}

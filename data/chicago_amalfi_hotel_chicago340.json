{"city": "chicago", "title": "Brilliant!!", "text": "WOW! I felt compelled to write this review becuase of the excellent stay I had. What can I say that others have not already said? This hotel is strategically located in downtown Chicago. It has an open bar between 5:30 - 7:00 in that will help kick-start any evening. Did I mention it serves appetizers too during this time? The free DVD rentals downstairs in the lobby are a great addition. The breakfast bar was always fully stocked with juices, muffins, tea, coffee (you name it). The hotel staff, although some are kind of older (40s, 50s) will try the best they can to point you in the right direction. Next time I travel to Chicago, you can be sure I'll be checking to see if Amalfi has any suites.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-22"}

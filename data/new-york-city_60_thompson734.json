{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Soggy night", "text": "We needed a place for a one night stay in the Soho area. The hotel looks nice and our room was nice; however, when we returned from the reception, my backpack which was on the floor in a corner, was soaked through (luckily there wasn't much in it) - there was a leak under the carpet in the corner of the room and the carpet was all wet. We called the management and they apologized, but couldn't move us to another room and didn't offer any sort of compensation for the problem. I expected better for the proce tag of this hotel.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-09-09"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Value - Great Experience", "text": "My rating of &quot;Above Average&quot; is based on the value I got for my dollar. It's not a five star hotel, but it doesn't claim to be, either. It was clean, quiet and comfortable, which is all I care about when I'm spending most of my time exploring the city. The rooms aren't huge, but there is adequate space to lay down your luggage and move around the room (the bathrooms were especially roomy, which my girlfriend appreciated). The beds were comfortable, and I didn't hear a peep from any of my neighbors. The staff was helful and friendly, which is always appreciated. Location was pretty good - somewhere between Chinatown and Japantown, which turned out to be the two places we spent most of our time. I didn't think the area was any worse or better than most places we visted. I did encounter a few homeless people within a few blocks of the hotel, but it seemed like there were homeless people everywhere I went and was therefore nothing out of the ordinary. If you stay anywhere downtown, it's going to be the same.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-01-30"}

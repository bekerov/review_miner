{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Good deal for the price", "text": "The Adante Hotel is located in a convenient spot and is a good base for a weekend of sightseeing. The rooms are what you'd expect from a budget hotel: small, utilitarian, and lacking the amenities that you'd find in higher-priced hotels. The rooms are very clean, and the management was professional. I had no problems checking in or out. The rooms were quiet, although you could hear the sounds of the city below with the window open. The window was open because there is no A/C. This is not a horrible thing given the frequent breeze in SF, but you'll want to know that there's no A/C ahead of time. I lucked out with a weekend of beautiful cool weather, but you'll want to check the weather forecast before booking here to ensure you're not in a heat wave. The murals painted on the walls are kind of kitschy and fun in a weird way. I would stay here again if the weather was cool enough.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-25"}

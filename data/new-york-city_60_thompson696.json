The staff was awesome! I was there with my Husband and 4 year old son on a last minute Holiday treat before heading back To CA. We were going to stay close to JFK, (only a 30 minute cab ride the next morning) but why, this was a great idea, and we will definately be back.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-01-12"}

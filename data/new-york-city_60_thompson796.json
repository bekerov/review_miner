We loved it! The room, on the 10th floor, was fantastic - comfy bed, excellent bathroom and a great view across Soho. The room was a comfortable size - we had a friend visit and there was more than enough room for three people to sit around. The turndown service - STILL water and Fat Witch brownies - was a treat. The staff, particularly those on the front desk and the bellboys, were always friendly and didn't show any attitude (though they looked really cool!). The location was superb! We loved Soho and there were some great restaurants near the hotel (try the small little Greek restaurant on Thompson Street, just up the road from the hotel - YUM!). We stayed at 60 Thompson during NYC Fashion Week so there were lots of beautiful people around the hotel (including a fashion shoot in the lobby), but that just made our stay more interesting. After we left NYC, we spent a month traveling around the US (including Boston, Washington DC, New Orleans, Vegas, SF and LA) and stayed in similar style and standard hotels and 60 Thompson was definitely the best. Don't listen to the people who have posted negative comments about this hotel - it's not true! One final comment -we got a great rate through Quikbook (used them for stays in other States and the rates were always the best and the rooms were always exceptional). Enjoy your stay at 60 Thompson - it really made our visit to NYC even more memorable!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-04-12"}

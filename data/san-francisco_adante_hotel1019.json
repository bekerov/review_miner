{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Exceptional Value!", "text": "Adante hotel is located a few blocks from the Union Square on Geary Street. It is a clean hotel and at $71 per night it was a great value! The rooms are clean and a good size, the staff are very courteous and professional, the location is the key. One thing I was confused about the the hotel's theme - it has an Italian/mediterranean theme but the room have tropical frescos in it. Another thing is the pillows - they were not great but then we found extra pillow in the drawers. We were very happy with our experience there and will stay there again.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-30"}

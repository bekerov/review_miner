{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Deal but avoid room 210", "text": "Just back from my stay in room 210. Nice room but the back wall (where your head sits on the pillow at bed time) sits right up against the outdoor seating for a bar called &quot;The Tipsy Pig&quot; that faces Chestnut Street. It is LOUD until about midnight or 1am. I just drank enough wine that sleep was easy. :) I would avoid 210 and probably 310 if that's the room above. The room was nice, the bed was VERY comfy and the staff was super helpful and pleasant. I would definitely stay here again. I did have one issue during my stay which was handled directly and immediately upon my reporting it. As for nearby things to do: Exit the hotel, and ignore the IHOP, and go north to Chestnut St. Plenty to eat, shop and do there. Also the bus to downtown, Little Italy and Chinatown stops here. To save a few bucks, pay the money for the microwave and refrigerator, then head to the Safeway in the Marina District (a nice walk thru the homes) and stock up on picnic supplies and breakfast items.) Grab a Muni pass at the Powell street cable car end of line and ride the cable cars and muni (bus and rail and street cars) to get around. Save TONS on cab fair and soak up some culture!", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-29"}

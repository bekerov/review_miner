{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Best quality for money in area", "text": "I travel from out of state to work in this part of town once a month and have tried most of the budget hotels in this area. This is my favorite and if I get a good deal I stay here (price between the hotels fluctuate -- Travel Lodge Presidio, Greenwich Inn are also fine options). Rooms clean, staff helpful and it's in good location. Only drawback is that Lombard can be loud so try and get a room beyond the main court yard as traffic and loud passers by can be loud.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-15"}

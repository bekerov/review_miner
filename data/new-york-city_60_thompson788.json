{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "A SOHO Sweetspot", "text": "Need a hotel in SOHO at a reasonable price, with an outrageously courteous and helpful hotel staff, a rooftop bar and lounge with spectacular views of Wall Street and the Empire State Building, clean rooms, comfortable beds, quiet air conditioning that has controls that actually work, and great people watching? 60 Thompson is it. There are great eats and bars in the neighborhood and the art galleries are right around the corner. We'll definitely stay here again the next time the grandparents can watch the kids!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-08-09"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "OK for the Price; Excellent customer service", "text": "Well, I read the previous comments and all I can say is that I had a different experience. Staff was very proactive and educated, willing to help all the time. The room was good for the price. Location in downtown, you cannot beat that. I know, it is not the GREATEST place on earth, but they are trying to provide a clean and good service. I definetely come back to the Abigail Hotel and I hope that you do so too. RELAX.AGAIN, it is not the best for the &quot;picky&quot; individuals.", "hotel": "abigail_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-03-14"}

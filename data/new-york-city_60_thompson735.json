{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "A Rare Luxury in NYC", "text": "I just returned from my second stay at 60 Thom, and it was just as enjoyable the second time. When I arrived, I was extremely surprised and impressed to find that Michael, the doorman, remembered me from my last visit, some 8 months prior. With a big smile and warm welcome, he and his colleague Jordan, took care of my car and bags and made me feel right at home. I have been to many other boutique hotels in NY, and more often than not, they seem to think that a snooty, aloof staff is somehow a mark of their exclusivity. Not at 60 Thom, where the staff are genuinely friendly and warm and helpful and welcoming, a rare luxury in NYC. The room was very nice, understated in it's modern design... not trying too hard. Little touches like heavy crystal drinking glasses, a beautiful large flat-screen tv, beautiful leather wall tiles, and ultra-comfortable beds make the room warm and inviting. An iron in the room would have been nice, however. The roofdeck is also a great amenity; hip scene with lots of sexy international types. All in all, I would definitely return to 60 Thom ... in fact, I promised Michael that I would. Now, I just have to hope that I can find a good rate on Quikbook when I return, because the regular rates are a bit pricey.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-09-05"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Upscale - moderate price", "text": "Purchased 2 rooms, 3 nights through Priceline. Our party consisted of 4 adults, one child. The staff at 70 Park Avenue were so nice. The hotel had a kid's fun kit ready for us at check in and the child with us thought it was great. The kids even get a comment card so they can say what they feel about the hotel - and that was a very &quot;grown up&quot; touch for the child in our group. The rooms, while small, were nicely furnished, clean and quiet (we were on the 16th &amp; 17th floors, though - so maybe some of the lower rooms would hear more street noise). The beds were very comfortable. Both rooms had a view of the Empire State Building! The hotel is 4 short blocks from Grand Central station so getting around was a breeze! We would have liked to have a coffee pot in our room, but the hotel does offer free coffee and tea in the lobby during the morning and we took advantage of it. And there is a Starbucks on the next block. There is a restaurant/lounge at the hotel but we didn't eat there so can't comment on it other than to say it's available. Part of our group did go to the lounge one night. It was tasteful and quiet - the drinks were high priced, but it is a hotel lounge! Lots of restaurants on surrounding side streets and there is a neat market at Grand Central Station - we bought sweet treats there!. We would definitely stay at the 70 Park Avenue Hotel again!", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-02-17"}

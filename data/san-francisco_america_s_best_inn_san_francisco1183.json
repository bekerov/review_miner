{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Bargain and Great Location", "text": "I had read the reviews prior to staying at this hotel and I was pleasantly surprised during our stay. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were nothing fancy, but very clean (no over-powering smells). I felt completely comfortable. Other hotels cost 2-3 times as much or more. This one offered free parking which elsewhere cost $25-$45 a night. The parking is cramped and if you must double park you have to leave your keys with the front. desk. It worked out better than expected and they never had to move our car. Breakfast was delicious muffins and doughnuts along with coffee. They did not offer plates or much of an area to eat. They request you gather your food and take it back to your room. The location is superb. It is within walking distance to Fishermans Wharf and &quot;The Crookedest Street&quot;. There is a grocery store and Starbucks not too far away as well. There is some street noise at night, but your in the middle of an active city. It wasn't too bad.", "hotel": "america_s_best_inn_san_francisco", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-11"}

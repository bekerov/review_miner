{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Nice place to stay", "text": "Just came back from a weekend at the Adante. The location was pretty good, about 3-4 blocks walk from Union Square, and a bus line (the 38 I believe) stops right in front of the hotel.The hotel is nice, cute, they seem to have an underwater/fish theme in the rooms which was amusing. The room was small, but clean, and the bathroom was huge, no view to speak of (alley), but I didn't go to San Fran to look out the window. Also there was no a/c, which normally I wouldn't worry about in San Fran, but they had record highs while we were there. Opening our small window and turning on the ceiling fan made it cool enough to sleep.The front desk clerks were very friendly and helpful. We didn't bother with the continental breakfast, it didn't seem like much. Overall a nice stay, no complaints!", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-21"}

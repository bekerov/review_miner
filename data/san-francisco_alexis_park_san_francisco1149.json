{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Excellent value!", "text": "I pretty much agree with everything else said here. I stay in hotels about 48 nights a year and this is probably the cleanest I have ever stayed in.Rooms have evidently been recently renovated and are very nice, though somewhat cozy (small). There is a bit of street noise and you can occasionally here people next door, but it is bearable.The showers are the best; they have spa-like sprayers in the wall that give your back a nice massage. Toiletries are basic but included. I forgot my toothbrush and they happily gave me a nice brand name one instead of the cheap ones you usually get.Fairly central location with easy bus access to anywhere. I recommend getting one of the SFMuni Passports; they provide unlimited rides on the streetcars, cablecars and buses.Good deli across the street and several other small restaurants within a block or two although I didn't try them.Area is a little on the gray side but had no trouble; I saw fewer homeless around here than the rest of SF.Staff is excellent and very helpful. I would stay here again, especially for the price. I lucked out and could get a govt. rate which was only $71/night...can't beat that!", "hotel": "alexis_park_san_francisco", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-04-10"}

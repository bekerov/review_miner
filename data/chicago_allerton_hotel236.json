{"city": "chicago", "title": "A great stay!", "text": "We stayed for one night the last Saturday in July. I had booked two rooms through hotwire so I knew what to expect, the smallest rooms in the house. That's par for the course when getting a cheap rate, I wonder if sometimes other reviewers forget that. We arrived early in the afternoon, the bellman were readily available and handled our luggage. Upon going to 3rd floor checkin, the front desk happily obliged to check and see if we could check in early and they were able to get us rooms. Bell service brought our bags up within 5 minutes and were extremely courteous. Elevator waits were 2 minutes or less, and yes you do have to change elevators but it's an older building, thats the way it works in a lot of older dowtown buildings. The rooms were small, but extremely clean. Standard crowne plaza welcome package of eyemask, ear plugs, etc is always a nice touch. Bathroom was very clean and for being small had a great walk in shower with what must have been a 7 foot high shower head, great for taller people who are used to sore backs from showering while traveling. Plus the location is excellent, a quick walk to Michigan Ave and to nearby CTA El stops. Would not hesitate to stay again!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-08-08"}

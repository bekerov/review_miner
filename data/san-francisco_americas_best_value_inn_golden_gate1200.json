{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Nice room cheap price great neighborhood", "text": "I went with my husband for 3 days, so we spent 2 nights there. The check-in was at 2pm, but we arrived from LA at 10am, so as we expected the room was not ready at all. The front desk employee offered us the laundry room to leave our luggage in order to take a walk in San Francisco. When we returned at 6pm after visiting Alcatraz jail, the room was ready. Not too big, but it had a king size, hot water, hairdryer, a TV. It was enough for us. The &quot;breakfast&quot; is very funny, you take the breakfast in the front desk area, next to the guests who are checking in or out. You only have coffee or tea and a few muffins. You take the breakfast stood up, no chairs, no table, nothing. However, the hotel is well ubicated. We took a tour and the tour bus passed through Lombard Street, we just went down in front of our hotel. Next to Lombard Street, it's Chestnut Ave. with a lot of restaurantes, cafes and shops.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-07"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Very Charming", "text": "I just returned from a 3 night girls weekend in Chicago and stayed at the Allerton Crowne Plaza. I have to say that I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews. I am happy to say that we had a wonderful experience. The valet greeted us in a very friendly manner and was helpful. We checked in at the beautiful 3rd floor foyer and the staff were helpful and attentive. Our room was very clean, not very big but really what do you expect for $115. The location is unbelievable, the best location that I have stayed while in the windy city and I travel there yearly. We called for extra towels twice and they arrived at our door within 5 minutes. We called to have our car pulled out and it was at the front door within minutes. The staff were courteous and helpful with directions and recommendations. The work out room on the 25th floor was very nice. I cannot say enough about my stay. If you are looking for a clean, central location with an affordable price, I highly recommend this hotel. I did not have any problems.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-31"}

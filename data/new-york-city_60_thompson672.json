{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Alotta Moolah", "text": "Pros: fantastic location, hip, trendy, clean rooms, good toiletries, friendly at the desk; great chocolate boutique a few doors down. Cons: snooty door guys (stepped right in front of us as we were returning from dinner one night and, with a total attitude, asked my boyfriend &quot;can I help you?&quot; when we told him we were guests of the hotel, he just stepped aside, with no apology; rooms are microscopic (but this is typical for NYC). Overall, no real service for the amount you pay. We like Soho, but will probably try somewhere else when we visit again in May.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-03-20"}

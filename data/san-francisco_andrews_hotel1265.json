{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "European Style Hotel in an Excellent Location!", "text": "We chose this hotel due to the location and excellent price. Although the room was small and the bathrooms tiny, the location made up for it. There is only a small lift so sometimes you had to wait or just walk down the very narrow stairs. The staff was cordial, and overall we felt that for the price, you can't go wrong staying at this hotel. The only thing I thought that was odd, was that they were spray painting doors during the morning/day -- so when you walked out of the room there was a very strong paint smell!", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-02"}

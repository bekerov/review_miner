{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great location but unfriendly staff and poor plumbing.", "text": "$60 per night for parking with NO in/out privilege. About $300 per night for our room, which was about as good as I could find in Manhattan, that seemed like a nice place. The lobby had stained carpet and the apples in the bowl had rotten spots...not too attractive when you first walk in. Although it is an old building, the room furnishings were nice. Nice linens. However, the plumbing needs updated. Drain in tub didn't work, and it took forever for them to send someone up to fix it, but he didn't have the part, so he substituted something else. Very low water pressure. They never did anything about it.Staff, including manager, was not friendly at all. Since the plumbing never got fixed the entire 3 days we were there, they reluctanly took off one day of parking, after I almost begged. They tried to charge us for an extra day of parking, anyway, so the manager was convinced he'd given us 2 free days. We tried explaining that we weren't there 3 full days, yet he wanted to charge us for 4 days.Great location. You can see the front of Grand Central Station when you walk out of the hotel and look left.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-26"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great great location -- tiny tiny room", "text": "We stayed at the hotel for two nights. Terrific location. It's just across the street from the subway &amp; there's a great international newstand around the corner. For those who indulge in Starbucks, there's one right next to the hotel. Our room was really small. The queen-size bed felt more like a twin. The room was clean but not smartly designed. There's a great big flat screen TV -- but no hooks for your coat. The bathroom floor was heated -- but there's virtually no closet space. Great shelves for magazines -- but very little drawer space. Talk about priorities all mixed up!Overall, our stay was pleasant &amp; the staff was pleasant. The price was right too.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-02-08"}

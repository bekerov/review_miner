{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great location", "text": "Meant to write this earlier. My stay at the 60 Thompson was for 3 nights early October. Checked in early so I had a room with no view. I agree with another review that said the plumbing was very noisy. It was heard throughout the night when people got in bed late. The gym was small and cramped with a few machines and you stare at mirrors or the small tv screes. There are no disinfectant sprays but a water cooler is availaber. The bar was great, delicious cocktails. Very mixed crowd on a Sunday night. Most of the time the concierge was not there so the front desk took all the calls. I borrowed a international transformer from them, but it took them a long time to find someone available to bring it upstairs. Other than that, it can be difficult to find a taxi during dinner hours with all the shoppers finishing their trip in Soho.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-11-28"}

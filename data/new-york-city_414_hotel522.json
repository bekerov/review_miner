{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Very Happy at the 414!", "text": "We arrived at the 414 on Jan. 24th to begin a weekend celebration of my 50th birthday. What a great place to stay! Probably the best feature is the location ~ close to Times Square, several subway stations, and Restaurant Row is right there. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. Breakfast in the morning was just enough before heading out for sight seeing or shopping. Greg was absolutely wonderful! He loves his job and it shows. He takes great care to be sure that all guests are comfortable and he goes out of his way to help with recommendations, reservations, etc. Economically speaking, I think you're getting a great value for your money when you stay here. I look forward to staying here again on our next trip to NYC!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-03"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Lots of Potential Lots of problems Great Location", "text": "We arrived to a pleasant staff to be told that our room category (King Junior suite) was not available. In fact the hotel was overbooked. They offered us a standard room with a double bed and a promise to move trhe next day. It was late so we agreed. There was not a sister property available we were told. The next day the promised room was not available either. Bad business.Unwilling to move to another property we stayed the 2nd night. We were comped both nights. I would be willing to pay for an enjoyable hotel stay.OTHER PROBLEM AREAS: The safes are not bolted down in the rooms. I carried mine down to the front desk to show them.They have five elevators in the old building only 3 are used for guests. The others are for service employees. There are long waits at check inand especially check out. I advise you if you are on a middle floor to take an up elevator to get down. We waited 20 minutes at first to check out. Our room was not cleaned the first day until we returned at 430pm and called. Parkinf is $51 USE SELF PARK DOWN THE BLOCK FOR $38. No refridgerators in room.THE GOOD POINTS. Friendly staff even in the face of overbooking and the problems it causes for the staff. The place was very clean. The location was excellent.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-01"}

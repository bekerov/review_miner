But everything needed was provided in a well-designed and aesthetically pleasing space. The bed, linens and towels added to a feeling of luxury and style.The staff was the real standout in an otherwise great experience. Every single individual working at the hotel took the time to greet me. Anyone that I addressed with a request, question or simply a &quot;hello&quot; responded warmly and wholeheartedly. Their friendliness (which was never anything but respectful) created the sense of having a home base in NYC and really added to the pleasure of my trip.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-06"}

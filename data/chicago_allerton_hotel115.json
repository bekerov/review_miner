{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great price for a perfect location.", "text": "I booked our 2 night stay at the Allerton through their website and got a king bed room for $130/night. I would suggest flying there if possible because parking is $51/day. (most of the downtown Chicago hotels have crazy parking fees)1. great location - right in front of Crate and Barrel on Michigan Ave. Seriously, for the price you can't beat the location.2. Water pressure - not so good, but it is an older hotel.3. Decor was very nice and the hotel was very clean.4. Yes, folks the elevators are slow and hit or miss.5. New fitness center with new equipment on the 25th floor that has a view of the city. 6. Easy check in and check out - we were able to check in at 9am because our flight was early and we requested it.7. The biggest downfall of this hotel is the fact that you can hear EVERYTHING that is going on in the hallways or your neighbors room. Some dumb guy was talking on his cell phone in the hallway at 3am and I had to open my door and tell him to shut up because I heard every word he was saying. That was the most frustrating part of all.8. Hotel restaurant is very expensive and not worth the price. Check out BICE an italian place right down the street that was fantastic and reasonably priced.Overall - I would certainly stay here again but for only a few days. There is a Walgreens about 2 blocks away if you are worried about snacks or pop.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-06"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Disgusting!", "text": "I would be the Canadian women referred to in the previous review. This was the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. The first night we stayed in a king suite on the second floor. It was extremely filthy. The rug was so dirty that we didn't feel comfortable in bare feet. The couch was dirty and sagged in the middle. Although we had two windows they didn't allow in any light in as they looked out onto a narrow space between buildings that was littered with cigarette buts, pigeon poop and garbage. We were aghast. They wanted to charge us $179 the first night and $199 the second. The nerve! When we complained and said we would not stay in the room another night and that we wanted a reduced rate they moved us to a double room on the fifth floor. They said the rate for that room was $199 but they would give it to us for $149. They refused to reduce the previous nights rate because they had closed their books for that day?! We did not take advantage of the continental breakfast because it looked totally unappetizing . if you like cheap store bought muffins or white doughy bread you might disagree. Anyway do not stay here. It is disgusting.The only good thing about the hotel was the desk staff Patient. The management should be ashamed of themselves. I just reviewed the hotel website and they describe their hotel as clean. Very far from the truth.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-19"}

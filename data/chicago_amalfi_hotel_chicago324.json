{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great hotel great location", "text": "This was a gem of a place. I found an internet rate of $153 a night and they matched it when I called. Call the hotel direct, not the toll free reservation line to get the match. Room was spacious and clean, beautifully furnished. It's in a great location. Loved the breakfast ON EACH FLOOR. Just run right out in your robe for coffee, bagels, pastries, fruit, yogurt - the works. Took advantage of the free happy hour with drinks and apps one afternoon. The attendant was great - warned us when our brand of red wine was getting low and set the bottle back for us to finish. Wish this happy hour was in a better place - perhaps with more atmosphere - but it was a good way to unwind and relax.Check in and out were both a breeze and everyone was very friendly and nice. Will stay here again next trip to Chicago.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-07"}

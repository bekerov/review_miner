{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Nice hotel very close to the wharf and other activities", "text": "We tried out a tall room which Kimpton offers in many of their properties. The accommodations were good for tall people except the robes weren't nearly long enough for my 6'10&quot; boyfriend. The room was pretty large and had some extra amenities such as a DVD player and an iHome alarm clock in addition to the usual hotel things. The 5 pm wine hour was a nice touch. We enjoyed the restaurant too, especially the clam and corn chowder.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-09"}

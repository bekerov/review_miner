{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Average", "text": "Lots of positives - bathrooms are fantastic, staff were very, very helpful, bar was great, free wireless and a great location. But we had problems with the aircon as it has been switched off for the Fall and Winter but we were staying in early November during a very warm spell. For one night, it was too hot to sleep and we were considering checking out. It was only after we (and others) complained enough times that the aircon was switched back on. The room was also very small and painted beige, so it didn't look a lot different to a cheap motel room. The walls were also very thin. Another disappointment was the roof top bar which is closed for the Fall and the Winter, even though the weather was very warm.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-11-24"}

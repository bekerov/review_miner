{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Good stay at the Adante", "text": "We booked our stay at the Adante Hotel via their website after reading the reviews on trip advisor and were not disappointed. The room was small but adequate and we were thankful to have our own bathroom which seems to be a luxury in a boutique or budge hotel in San Francisco. The hotel is located only a couple of blocks away from Union Square which is an easy walk. We also had little trouble making our way on foot from the Hotel to the BART station at Powel Street to travel to the airport when leaving San Francisco. We found the staff at reception friendly and helpful. There is also a cafe attached to the hotel that does real coffee. All in all we had a good stay at the Adante Hotel and would recommend it to others. The only thing I would suggest is that you ask for a room toward the rear of the hotel as our room was at the front of the hotel on the street and was a little noisy but we slept ok.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-29"}

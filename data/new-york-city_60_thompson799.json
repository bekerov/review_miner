{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great!!", "text": "As frequent visitors to NYC, over the years we have migrated down to lower NY after years of staying in midtown botique hotels (Royalton, Morgans, Hudson etc.) The Soho Grand is great, but the rooms are a little small. 60 Thompson is an oasis. The staff was super, the room was large, and the location cannot be beat. Their restaurant, Thom, was closed for renovations. We are looking forward to our next stay at 60 Thompson, and the re-opening of the restaurant alone will probably be worth the trip. If you want top notch service, along with a &quot;private apartment&quot;feel, this is the place. We cannot say enough good things!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-03-08"}

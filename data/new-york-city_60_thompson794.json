{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Lovely!", "text": "I recently flew to New York to celebrate my birthday with friends. The lobby, my room, lounge (and doormen) were all gorgeous. The front desk, very helpful. My linens, robe, towels etc. all new, sparkling clean and comfy. My stay at 60 Thompson ranks about the best experience I've had at a hotel. The restaurant was closed for renovation which allowed me to explore the neighborhood even more. Lovely!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-05-11"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "The Andrews is excellent", "text": "My wife and i stayed at the Andrews Hotel for four nights in August, and it was terrific - just as it was when we stayed there during our honeymoon six years ago.Yes, it's small, and yes, the bathrooms are cramped. But you know this going in.The staff is terrific, the complimentary sodas and bottled water in the micro-fridge was a great touch, and everyone likes a free glass of wine each night.Also, the bed was about as comfortable a bed as I've experienced. I'd recommend this hotel again and again.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-08-15"}

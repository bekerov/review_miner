{"city": "chicago", "title": "A Gem on the Mag Mile", "text": "When we arrived at the Allerton, we were upgraded to a suite as Priority Club members. The kind man who checked us in at a desk in the lobby listened to our preferences and found the perfect room. We booked online at the hotel's site and received an excellent rate, so I found the upgrade a pleasant surprise.The service was exceptional and the bellmen were extremely helpful and pleasant.I'm partial to older hotels that have been remodeled. The Allerton has much character and with that may come smaller rooms and elevators. It's worth it.We loved our 17th room with a marvelous distant view of the Water Tower and Lake Michigan. Well thought out details. Great location with steps away from many restaurants. We would return.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-07-03"}

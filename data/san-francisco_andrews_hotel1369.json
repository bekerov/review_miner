{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Andrews was great", "text": "The Andrews Hotel was great. The breakfast was above average for a continental breakfast, and the wine at Fino each night was a great place to unwind and plan where to go to dinner. We picked this hotel from the user reviews, and were pleased with it, for the price. The location is in a convenient area, we felt safe walking around, and the front desk provides itineraries based on your preferences. We really enjoyed the insider's tips for &quot;Tip Top Views,&quot; and &quot;Our Favorites: Good Food and Cheap Fun.&quot; The bathroom and rooms were small but clean. We'll stay again.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-09-17"}

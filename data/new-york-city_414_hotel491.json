{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Just Neutral", "text": "Had high hopes for this hotel after reading other reviews. We used to stay in an old brownstone hotel in NYC that was closed 2 years ago and thought that this would compare to it . We were a bit disappointed that it did not live up to our expectations. Room was very bland and small. We were always banging into TV hanging on wall when trying to walk around the bed, it was that close! Fresh paint may perk it up a bit too. Breakfast was ok. Hotel was fine if you get a reasonable rate. Which I believe you can get now. When in lobby we could hear front desk quoting rates and after paying $70 a night more, we felt like we really paid too much for what we got.Would stay here again if our other hotels are booked and we got a great rate. Not a bad hotel, just not as quaint as I expected.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-02"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great value!", "text": "Stayed there for a weekend; very low-key and quiet place; no hustle and bustle in the lobby, it's like coming home to a condo. Decor is clean, simple, and modern. Rooms are not huge but comfortably sized. Loooved the double shower heads!! Location is convenient enough, a block from House of Blues, and a couple of blocks walk to Michigan Ave. Good restaurants around it (Harry Caray's, Smith and Wollensky, etc.). Overall, the hotel is clean, comfortable, and great value for the price. Highly recommended and would stay there again!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-03-15"}

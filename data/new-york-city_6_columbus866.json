{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Nice Stay for $200", "text": "I arranged my one night stay through Quikbook, at a rate of 199.00. With this rate in mind, I found the hotel very nice. It was clean, modern, safe and nicely located in Columbus Circle. The staff were friendly and fairly helpful for my few questions. The only drawbacks I found during my stay were the loud doors and cleaning staff that seemed to be yelling &quot;housekeeping&quot; all morning long. Minor issues...As has been mentioned, the rooms are small, there are no views nor real amenities. I would not pay the rates they list on their website (425 for the queen room etc.); even in Manhattan you can find a better room for that price. I only needed a place to sleep near Central Park for one night, and did little more than sleep in the room, so it was perfect for my needs at the reduced rate. Nice new option in the city.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-03"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "comfortable space in central location on a budget", "text": "Two blocks from Union Square, the Andrews Hotel was a comfortable and convenient place for us to stay during our vacation Stayed 5 nights February 2-7 in a petite suite, room #701. I booked directly through the hotel requesting room on higher floor. Upgraded to petite suite for the same price as Bay King. Highlights included down comforters on comfortably soft king bed, bonus sink in bedroom, two large closets, fresh daisies, fridge stocked daily with free soda and water. and very clean. Didn't get a chance to try the free wine at the bar in the evening, but liked having the fruit/pastry/juice/coffee offerings outside our room in the morning. Plus they left a basket of apples out in the hall all the time. Borrowed dvds free from the hotel's collection one night when I couldn't sleep. Rooms had plenty of natural sunlight through bay windows which accounts for the fading but the peach and green decor could use some updating. Oscar Morales at the desk was most engaging and insghtful about current events and happenings in the city. He completely won over our local friends with his spot on recommendations and charm. Other clerks at the desk were very accommodating and helpful.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-02-08"}

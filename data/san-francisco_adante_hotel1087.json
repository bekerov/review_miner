{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Value!", "text": "Stayed at the Adante Hotel from 7/29 thru 8/1 and were very impressed with the value of this budget hotel. I was somewhat skeptical and paranoid about the location being on the edge of the tenderloin district but the location turned out to be excellent. We hauled suitcases at 9:30 at night from the Powell Street Station up to the hotel with absolutely no problems. Had two teenager with us, quite an eye opener for them with all the hustle bustle and happenings on the street. The hotel itself was very clean, unique and friendly. I suppose you could pay the same and stay at a Holiday Inn but you would be experiencing cookie cutter boredom. Not so at the Adante. Our room was small but adequate and did I mention clean? Our room faced Geary so it was noisy if the windows were left open but we closed them at night and ran the ceiling fan and this was more than comfy and I sleep hot. The front desk was friendly and helpful, the continental breakfast is good enough to hold you over til you can get some real breakfast. Dont expect luxury, but for what you pay you will be more than pleasantly surprised!!!", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-08-10"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Staff!", "text": "We are in NY at least twice a year for business. 6 Columbus was won on Priceline for one night. The second night we booked directly through the hotel's website.While the hotel's decor is a little too dark for our taste, the staff was outstanding. Everyone was friendly, professional and helpful. We would definitely stay there again just because of the staff and location.We upgraded our room to a king. We were told it was worth the additional $50/night. The room was still on the smaller side. Pros: Outstanding staff, nice hotel, great area, complimentary newspaper, nighttime, brownie at turndown. Also great Sushi restaurant. Cons: Decor a bit dark. Bathroom door is glass so if you have light on at night it shows through. Door to room is heavy and it is difficult to close quietly.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-27"}

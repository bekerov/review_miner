{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great little hotel prfect location", "text": "We stayed two nights in June and for the price this was a great place. Our room was on the second floor facing the courtyard and was very quite. The room was a nice size, the bathroom was large. The furniture and linens seemed new and the bed was very comfortable. The windows opened, but no screens. A continental breakfast was served in the lobby - cereal, muffins, juice. We didn't use it but I saw a computer and printer in the lobby for guests. The location was great, right at the end of Restaurant Row with a short walk to Times Square and subway stop. Close to Penn Station. The only small negatives were poor lighting (40 watt bulbs??) and the room could have used a new coat of paint - the walls looked a little dingy.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-07"}

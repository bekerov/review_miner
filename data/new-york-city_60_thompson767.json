{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "way overrated", "text": "My family stayed at 60 Thompson after hearing from everyone it was a great hotel and the best place to stay downtown, very chic and cool. Wow, we were sooo underwhelmed. Our rooms were tiny, with no amenities to speak of. The view of a brick wall was less than stunning, and the comfort level all in all, average at best. I had stayed at the Gaansevort a year ago and would recommend it over 60 Thompson. One day my daughter and I were asked to leave the lobby at 6pm because there was a private party. We couldn't go in the lobby! The staff was nice, that is the only thing about the hotel that was good. I guess if I was Russell Crowe, I could get a great room.  I can't tell you enough how uncool this cool hotel is.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-05-25"}

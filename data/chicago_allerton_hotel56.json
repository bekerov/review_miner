{"city": "chicago", "title": "No so great.", "text": "The room was super tiny. It had two beds and they were so close together it might as well have been one bed. The carpet was shabby, with rips it it and was very dirty looking. We had to wait over an hour past check-in time to get our room and then I believe we would have sat in the lobby even longer if we hadn't complained. It was like they just forgot we were waiting. The lobby and common areas are absolutely georgeous but the room we had was like it was another building. The bellman makes himself very scarce and might ignore you for a while when he is there. Would definitely not stay there again.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-22"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Not Bad Not Great", "text": "The good: We paid a bit more and stayed in a room with a king size bed, thus room size was adequate. However, if you don't pay a bit more, from reading precious posts, the room size may suffer.The location was very central on the mile. Probably it's best feature. If wasn't for the location, probably would rate it a star lower.The not so good:Front desk staff and doorman were not customer service oreinted for this level of hotel (re: Allerton is not charging Best Western rates...). Seemed very odd that the doormen just stare at everyone and only offer a salutation AFTER the guest(s) offer one.Rooms have beeb refurbished over the years, yet redeem tired signs. Although our room was on a high floor, the view was diminished by very dirty windows. They could invest in some badly needed window cleaning.Elevators can be cramped and you will be intimate with other guests whether by choice or not due to everyone squishing into the hot elevators. Really a matter of preference here though--if in a hurry, you will be inconvenienced. Otherwise, you might just find them interesting from a historic standpoint. Since, I was not here on business, I personally did not find them an inconvenience or interesting...Overall: The Allerton offers no frills and subpar service, however it's central location, really it sole redeeming quality, saves it.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-05-05"}

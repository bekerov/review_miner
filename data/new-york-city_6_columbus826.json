{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Nice hotel some issues", "text": "Booked a queen room through Quikbooks. I was grateful to check in early since I had just flown in on the red eye. Staff were cordial and helpful. Room was a good size and stylish. Bed was comfy. Found a couple of short hairs pinned to the undersheet of the comforter. I'm pretty sure the sheets were clean for the most part, since the staff inspected the room before they allowed me to check in. Rarely heard any noise from other guests, except when they shut their doors. To lock the door there's really no way to shut it softly. Housekeeping sometimes chatted loudly in the hallway, and they start knocking loudly on doors around 8.30 am to clean the rooms. Bathroom was large. Bathtub drained slowly. Had to turn off the water to let the water drain, before turning it back on. The tub finally clogged up on the last day of my stay. At check-out, hotel tried to charge me $2.75 for the mini-bar, even though I didn't use it. I thought it was a fridge for my personal use. I explained this and they promptly removed the charge. Despite the negatives, I did enjoy my stay. I feel I got a good deal on the room (I've stayed at the Hotel East Houston, which was advertised at a similar price, but not nearly as nice). The hotel is conveniently across the street from metro station and shopping. Nearby coffee shops were okay. Preferred Whole Foods across the street for better prices and better tasting food than places nearby. Bouchon Bakery, in the same complex as Whole Foods, makes very good macarroons.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-18"}

The rooms are very clean and well kept. I really enjoyed the experience of living like a New Yorker...the block is fairly quite and the hotel is the only one on the block. There is a great pizza place and a sushi bar right next door. Even the continental breakfast was good and the staff was always ready and willing to help us out in any way. For example, Kabeem (sp?) became our hero while our stay in NYC...he got us into restaurants we requested and even wrote us a handwritten note after our stay, thanking us for our business. Customer service is definitely a HUGE priority here. Stay here--I promise you won't be disappointed!! Oh!..PS...Want to have a fabulous dinner in the neighbor?...go to &quot;44th and X&quot;....food was delicious and has a romantic atmosphere (a little loud though)..it's on the corner of 10th Ave. and 44th street. Enjoy your trip!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-04-18"}

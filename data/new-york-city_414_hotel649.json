{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "The Good and The Bad", "text": "Here's the low-down:The Good: Located in the former 'Hell's Kitchen', now trendy restaurants row and theatre district. Friendly Staff. Nice Sized Rooms for NYC. Complimentary breakfast with cereal, croisants, juice and coffee.The Bad: Street Noise at night from garbage trucks and restaurant deliveries. No Elevator. Bad TV reception. No Luggage storage room. King Size bed is really two twins with ridge down the middle.In Summary: For the money, you can't really complain because of the location near Times Square and the included breakfast and overall service. Just don't be expecting more than the three star hotel rating allows.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-11-05"}

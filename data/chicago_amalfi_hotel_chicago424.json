{"city": "chicago", "title": "Nice hotel", "text": "Stayed here for three nights. Hotel is halfway between boutique and business hotel. It is in North River, a 5-minute walk from N. Michigan Ave. Rooms were nicely decorated and clean. I did not find the free buffet breakfast that great as the choice was rather limited (no healthy options, only muffins and other pastries). The happy hour is a great idea but the room it is held in is very small and crowded.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-09"}

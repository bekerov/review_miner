It was the a/c unit for the hotel next door. We called the desk but they said they were completely booked and couldn't move us until tomm. Next day moved us to smaller room and there was a gap at the bottom of the door and it was very loud from the hall. we were lying in bed and could hear every conversation going on. It was clean, good location for subway use, took forever to get our car from valet. We have friends who recommended the hotel and stayed few weeks earlier and loved it and it was very quiet for them so may be hit or miss. the concierge was very good and friendly, front desk staff so so.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-09"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "A Thoroughly Charming Hotel", "text": "My experience at the Andrews Hotel (March 16-20, 2005) completely matches the positive comments below. The king room I had was such a nice change from the usual cookie-cutter hotel rooms; staying there felt more like staying in someone's elegant guest room. Pastel colors and floral motifs dominated, from the beautiful bed comforter to the full-length curtains, and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The continental breakfast laid out in the hall each morning was more than ample for me (coffee, tea, juice, and a basket of baked goods), and the complimentary glass of wine each evening was a bonus. I don't understand the complaint below about the location: the Andrews is only two blocks from the St. Francis (the grande dame of SF hotels) and is literally just around the corner from the downtown theater and gallery district. From the airport, you can take Bart to Powell Street; from there it's a (slightly uphill) ten-minute walk past Union Square to the Andrews, or a three-minute cab ride. One note: The bathroom in my room was fine for me but was exactly the same size as the closet--about three feet wide--and would not have accommodated a large person. Other rooms, though, are laid out differently; ask about this when you make your reservation, and I'm sure the friendly hotel staff will be happy to help you select an appropriate room configuration.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-03-25"}

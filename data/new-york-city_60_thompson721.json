{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "A so so Hotel in Soho New York.", "text": "I am just back from a 4 night stay in New York with my husband and 6 friends. We were there to celebrate our friends 40th birthday. We choseThe 60 Thompson for its reputatuion as a boutique hotel. We knew it was expensive before going and naturally expected the service to match the price --it didn't. The place and staff are trying so hard to be trendy that it is clear good customer care and service is not a job requirement. The rooms probably very smart when first open are now a touch dull/shabby.and small.The bar is a very popular night spot for local trendies and celebs.it is a happening place but unfortunately hotel guests are not priority and in fact when we were there private parties meant we couldn't get into the bar and were actually asked to move from our seats.The best thing about the hotel was its location but I don't think that is enough to encourage me to go back to it.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-02-20"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Very Nice!", "text": "We got a great deal on this hotel through Quickbook ($200/night for a king room). The staff was very nice and helpful. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The room was very small, but for New York, it was fine. The location was great as well. Right across from Columbus Circle. There is a Whole Foods, so you can get anything you might need. The subway is there, too. Some things to be aware of:Room was tiny and although there was a desk and chair, it would be very awkward to actually have to work at the desk.There was no hair dryer or ironing board. I'm assuming I could've gotten these from Housekeeping had I needed them.The air conditioning is extremely loud. I got used to it, but if noises bother you, it might be a problem. We would definitely stay here again if we could get a similar rate. I don't think I would pay $300+, though.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-08"}

Bring your own hairdryer, they advertise in room, but did not see one.....Had to do without one....Skimpy towels too!!Elevator is kind of creaky!!The hotel is one-block from the Civic Center BART station and 4-block to Union Square and the Westfield Shopping Center(7-stories), they have a hugh Food Court in the Basement Level, ate there almost every day of our 4-day stay....They do have Belkin Wireless Hot-Spot in the Lobby only, FREE, the password is on the glass on desk clerk, it will not work in the room!", "hotel": "aida_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-10"}

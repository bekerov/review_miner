The room was clean and really nice, the beds were fantastic, and the service at this hotel is excellent as well as the location. If you are going to New York - this is the place to stay. I will give a few examples of what we experienced:- the concierge got us into some of the hippest restaurants and bars and upon arrival not only booked a really nice restaurant but also told THEM that it was our honeymoon so when we came to the restaurant they had arranged for champagne on the house and wished us the very best! (note: we have stayed in other hotels on Manhattan, essex house is one of them, but we have found that few hotels knows the meaning of a real concierge - but this! This is excellent. They know Where to go and they can get you there and this is really good value when you are in a city like New York)- everybody working in the hotel was really serviceminded and nice. And they remembered who We were.- fantastic room: clean, designerlook, Kiehl's products in the bathroom as well as bathrobe (We only missed slippers) - great food in the restaurant. the breakfast is really good - try it!- the location: the hotel is situated in a quiet street (so no noise at night) and still you are just a few footsteps away from everything: the restaurants, the bars, the clubs and the Metro.Next time we're going to New York - this is where we are staying!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-19"}

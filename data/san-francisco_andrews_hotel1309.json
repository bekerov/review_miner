{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Cute little hotel!", "text": "Stayed at the Andrews for 4 nights and had a pleasant stay. The hotel is just two blocks from Powell which made for a short walk from the bus/cable car. The room was small and our bathroom was a decent size. We had room 604. There was noise from the road/nearby restaurant but it wasn't unbearable. The walls are a bit thin but luckily our neighbors were quiet. The heater was putting out heat even though it was off but it never got too hot in the room. The decor was charming and the staff (with the exception of the night auditor) was very friendly and accommodating. The continental breakfast was just outside the door around the corner, that, along with the evening wine reception were nice treats! We would definitely stay there again!", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-03-06"}

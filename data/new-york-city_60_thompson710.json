{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Nasty staff and noisy", "text": "I stayed at the 60 Thompson for 2 nights. I asked for a quiet room when I got to the front desk as there was a great deal of music noise in the lobby bar. They selected a room and I stayed only a few minutes and went to dinner. I returned to find the music blaring and the room moving with the music. I called to the front desk and asked for another room. There were none, so they told me they could send up EAR PLUGS. They had put me in a room right over the DJ and speakers. They moved me the next day reluctantly and never apologized. No one apologized and I think the woman at the front desk thought it was probably funny as I heard her giggling when I left. I left a note for management and never heard from them.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-09-06"}

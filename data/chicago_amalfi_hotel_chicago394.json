{"city": "chicago", "title": "Fantastic hotel for a fun weekend getaway", "text": "My fiance and I decided to take a look at Chicago for a weekend as a potential residence in the future. We stayed at the Amalfi primarily because we wanted to be in the River North neighborhood, close to bars and restaurants and the running path. The Amalfi staff was friendly (definitely not uptight and rude) and the standard room was huge with a nice view. The bathroom was beautifully decorated and the shower therapeutic. To top it off, each night there is a two hour reception including unlimited antipasto type appetizers and a top shelf open bar and nice wine and beer choices, all included in your stay! Definitely a nice place for the fun-loving couple. We will be back!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-01-25"}

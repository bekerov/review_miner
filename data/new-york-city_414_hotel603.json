{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great find!", "text": "This hotel is in a fab location - so close to many attractions, yet also away from all the hussle and bussle on a quiet tree-lined street. A couple of blocks one way and you are in Times Sq and a walk away from Grand Central Terminal, MOMA, the Empire State building and the shops of 5th Avenue and Broadway. A couple of blocks the other way and you are by the Hudson River, taking in the view of New Jersey. A warm welcome from all the staff in the hotel, a light breakfast served every day and a great sized bedroom with en-suite. All rooms were just getting fitted with brand new flatscreen televisions as we were nearing the end of our stay as well. Hope to go back here the next time we're in NYC!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-01-16"}

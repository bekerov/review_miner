{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Quiet quaint right in the middle of it all- 414 Hotel Is a Jewel in Manhattan", "text": "My family and I spent 4 wonderful nights at this well run, made you feel at home lodging. It is located in the middle of Restuarant row, with very easy access to shows, events, Times Square, Central Park, etc. Questions about where to go and what to do? Just ask, the staff is ALWAYS there, ready to assist. The courtyard is a very nice touch, as is the nice selection for breakfast. We met guests from all parts of the world. If you want a safe, unique and comfortable place to stay, we recommend it highly!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-11-21"}

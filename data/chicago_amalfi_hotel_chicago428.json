It's a good small boutique hotel and a good alternative to a larger chain hotel.Pros:Free breakfast (continental)Free WifiBusiness CenterComfortable bed and bed linens.Very CleanAveda bath products.Good locationGood PricingCons:Towels are OK.Noise of construction.Sometimes slow and pokey wifi.Notables:Happy Hour is an odd experience. It's held in a conference room of some sort and it's like walking into a room of strangers. Only went once, not my kind of scene. Preferred spending time at Bin 36 up the street, better atmosphere.Our room was on the 5th floor towards the back, I was awaken each morning with the sound of trash trucks. No matter, had to get up anyway for conference.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-06-25"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Good location clean rooms friendly staff =Great value", "text": "The Adante was a great value for the price we paid($56). Yes, the rooms are small but they, along with the bathrooms, appear to be recently updated and are clean. Yes, there are homeless people in the area but there are homeless people all over town. This is not a bad area (two blocks away is) and although we are from a semi rural area we felt safe. There is $15 self parking two doors down. We drove and walked all over town. I thought the Geary Street location of the Adante was a great starting point for touring the city.  We also stayed at the Hyatt Embarcadero for our anniversary night. What a great view of the bay and what a hit on my wallet!", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-09-19"}

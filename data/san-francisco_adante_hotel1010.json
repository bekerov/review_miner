{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Very Good Value And Location", "text": "This hotel offers a cheap option in a central location just off Union Square. The staff were freindly and very helpful, the rooms were small but clean and the bed comfortable. The complimentary breakfast of juice, coffee, toast, and muffins was adequte rather than paying 10 dollars each morning. I was wary because of the price i paid but had no complaints and wouldnt hesitate to stay here again. I only encountered a couple of homeless people near the hotel most seemed to be on Powell Street and were no problem at all.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-18"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Not Bad!", "text": "We booked this hotel based on the TA reviews. Price was right at $199 per night plus $30 taxes. The location on 46th made it an easy walking distance to Times Square and not really a bad walk to anywhere else. One day we actually walked from the Metropolitan Museum all the way back to this hotel although we stopped several times. Walking much further than Rockefeller Center would be weather dependent however.Staff was reserved but friendly. We checked in early and had to leave baggage in the small lobby. It had been moved all the way to our 4th floor rooms when we came back. That was a nice touch since there is no elevator. Rooms were a little small but adequate and clean. We were in the front bldg but on the courtyard side and it was quiet. Morning breakfast was good with fresh baked goods. Lobby area is very small but had no problems with seating. On our last day there they arranged a car for transfer to LGA. I would stay here again because of the price advantage, location, and cleanliness. Just be prepared to do some stair climbing if on the 3rd or 4th floor.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-12-14"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "The Amalfi is a gem!", "text": "Several Trip Advisor reviews indicated that the Amalfi was terrific. They were right. I arrived at the hotel before 10 a.m. and the friendly staff let me check in right away! The rooms are spacious &amp; pristine, and the thermostat works and is idiot-proof. If you want, pull the blackout curtains to ensure that it stays dark, dark, dark in the room even as the sun rises. Chocolates (Ghirardelli - really) magically appear on the pillow in the evening. Housecoats and slippers are provided, the TV is huge and there's a minibar (with room in the fridge to store snacks). Breakfast is provided and includes lots of fresh fruit -- the coffee is even pretty good. I loved Chicago, in large part because this hotel was so comforting, welcoming and well-located. Most highly recommended!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-22"}

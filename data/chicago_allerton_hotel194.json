{"city": "chicago", "title": "Irritating or Charming? We Loved the Allerton", "text": "OK- right up front- the rooms are VERY small. If you are the kind of traveler who demands opulence and huge ornate lobbies and rooms- you won't like it here. Second- the &quot;lobby&quot; on the hotel is on the 3rd floor, and you must take 1 elevator to the 3rd floor and get off to get on another to go up to your room. This is a remnant of how hotels worked 1/2 a century a go. Some might find this irritating- my wife and I found it added to the charm. Whenever I reserve a room in an OLD hotel, I worry if it will feel old- musty- in need of refurbishment. Not here. The rooms and all comon areas have been refurbished and we found them charming. The staff was just great- great service with a smile and without an attitude. The location is simply the best in Chicago- right on the Mag MIle sandwiched between the Water Tower on one side and the Apple Store on the other.The only negatives we found were (1) no small fridge in the room, so left overs went to waste; (2) $10 internet charge per day (but this is almost standard in nicer hotels); (3) parking is expensive- $30/ night (again it is everywhere around this neighborhood); and (4) the hotel is close to Northwestern University Hospital ER, so occasional ambulances during the early AM (this could be a plus for some if your health is so-so). If 5 star to you means everything opulent- the best- regardless of price- go across the street to the Peninsula or Park Hyatt and spend an extra $250/night. But if your definition of 5-Star includes value for the dollar (and you can see small rooms and funky elevators as charming vestigial remnants of an earlier era rather then irritating) then the Allerton is hard to beat! My wife said &quot;Why would we stay anywhere else? This is it!&quot;", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-03-20"}

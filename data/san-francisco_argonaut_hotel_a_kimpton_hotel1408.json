{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "WOW", "text": "I love love love this hotel!When we arrived we were upgraded to a bay bridge view room! We also had a lovely bottle of red in the room upon arrivals (Were there to celebrate boyfriends birthday) The room was huge! Absolutly immaculate! Bed comfy! Bathroom again huge! It did take us a while to walk to the room from reception! This hotel is large!The only negative would be most of the things (food wise) in the mini bar were out of date! Lovely bar called Jack Murphys about 3 doors along and the best burgers in SF from In Out Burger about a 5 min walk away!Overall loved the hotel though and would deffo stay here again!", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-18"}

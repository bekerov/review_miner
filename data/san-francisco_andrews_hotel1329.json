{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great friendly hotel", "text": "The Andrews Hotel rooms were very small, but nicely decorated &amp; furnished, the cleanilness was excellent. The service was really good &amp; the hotel restaurant superb &amp; very popular with the locals. The free continental breakfast put out on each floor was excellent and the free glass of wine in the bar each evening of you stay was well worth getting back for (served between 5.30 - 6.30). The hotel is a long walk from Fishermans Wharf, but very close to Union Square. The roads are a bit of a killer with them being so steep, but is it not advisable to drive in the city as the parking is very limited. The cable car service is pretty good if you don't fancy walking everywhere. I wore my stepper &amp; on the day we walked over the Golden Gate Bridge we did 41,000 steps (approx 36.8km) so if you like walking it is ideal!! I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone, the room had one of the best showers I have ever used &amp; the bed one of the most comfortable I have slept in.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-04-30"}

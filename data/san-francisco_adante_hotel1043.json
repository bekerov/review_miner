I felt safe, the room was as pictured on the website and EXCEPTIONALLY clean. The bathroom was as clean as can be! The hotel staff were exceptionally friendly, courteous, helpful. They printed tourist resources directly for me from the internet. Continental breakfast was white bread toast, coffee, store bought muffins. For the price in San Fran, the cleanliness, and the hospitality of all staff, I would definitely stay again!", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-15"}

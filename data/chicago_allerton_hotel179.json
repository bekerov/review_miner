{"city": "chicago", "title": "great experience at The Allerton", "text": "This was our first stay at the Allerton. We found the hotel to be family friendly. The staff was friendly. There was not one hotel employee that did not say hi or good morning. The doorman is especially nice and helpful. Our room was small but we were not in it very much. This is a great location for any attraction in the city. There are quite a few things in walking distance and cab rides to Zoo, Pier were about $6.00. We actually walked back from the pier in about 20 minutes. I highly recommend using the Allerton.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-06-08"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great service and great location!", "text": "A friend and I stayed at this hotel and were very impressed. We arrived at the hotel at 11am and were pleasantly surprised when they let us check-in immediately. They had a selection, albeit small, of DVDs you could borrow for free. Upon request, they granted us a late check-out of 1pm. And, upon check-out, the front desk printed off my airline boarding passes for me. The room was spacious, the beds were exceedingly comfortable, and the bathroom was nicely appointed. We enjoyed the breakfast right outside our door every morning, though we wished they had some protein included in the offerings. The nightly wine and Hors d'ourves was a nice touch. The hotel was very centrally located to everything we wanted to do. I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Chicago!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-09-22"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Amazing Hotel", "text": "This hotel is simply fantastic. I was there 6 nights in April and I loved it. the rooms have good size and are very clean, and have plasma TV. The location is excellent, and very near the subway and Times Square. The breakfast is simple but tasty and, in addition gives you a good economy. The price of the hotel, among those over 30 who I researched, was one of the best.The apartments of the building from the bottom are the best because almost have no stairs and are very quiet. I recommend this hotel to all who want to stay in New York without paying a fortune for it.The hotel also offers a computer with internet for guests and the staff is simple but efficient.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-19"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Price and Service Marginal Location", "text": "The front desk staff could not have been more helpful and the queen suite room was large and comfortable. Overall, I found it to be good value, but there were a couple of concerns:1. I had bought the valet parking package. The check in time starts at 3pm and I arrived at about 3:40pm. The waiting area for valet parking is an area where there is no standing allowed between 4pm-6pm. I was a solo traveler and it was a struggle to try to check in and watch the car in the 30 minute wait for the one valet parking person to get to my car, with the fear of being towed.2. It's a only a 5 minute walk to Union Square, but it's in a borderline neighborhood (massage parlors, etc.), and I would not recommend it for nervous or inexperienced travelers.Overall, I would stay here again and recommend it to seasoned, budget minded travelers.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-31"}

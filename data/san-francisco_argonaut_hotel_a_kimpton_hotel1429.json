{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "You wont be disappointed !", "text": "If you want a reasonable priced hotel that is clean, convenient with good service this is it. I think that the almost 700 reviews with a 4.7 rating speak volumes about this hotel. Some people will always find something to whine about. Sure the odd person has some bad luck or some unforeseen occurrence, but this was not the case with us. I researched plenty before we booked at this hotel and could have spent a lot more money to stay at other hotels that didn't come close to the reviews that this hotel had. We had a great time and not on complaint. Sure, the restaurant beside is not ultimate dining experience, but there are plenty of other restaurants around. I am booking a trip for November with 3 friends for a football trip and will be returning, No question.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-16"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Awesome Stay", "text": "Had a Christmas party nearby and decided to spend the night at this hotel to avoid having to make the commute home. I really enjoyed the room's amenities, except for the price of course. I guess this is the norm these days in NYC and it is nice to splurge once in a while. I would definitely recommend this hotel as long as you can afford it.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-05"}

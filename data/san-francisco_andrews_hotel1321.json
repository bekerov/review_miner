{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great location", "text": "Great location 2 blocks from Union Square. Yes the rooms are small but they are very clean. The front desk staff are very helpful, breakfast is great (coffee, juice, fruit, fresh buns and pastries) , and who can argue with a free glass of wine in the afternoon. All in all, probably the best bargain in the Union Square area.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-11"}

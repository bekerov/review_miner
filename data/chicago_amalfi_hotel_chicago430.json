{"city": "chicago", "title": "Good alternative to large Hotels", "text": "I just recently stayed at the Amalfi with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. I was looking for a smaller hotel with a different vibe than the standard chain hotels. Overall I was satisfied with my stay.Travelers should note that the Amalfi is a 3-star CLASS hotel, and should not be confused with the 4 and 5 star RATINGS given in travel reviews.The room was clean and the bathroom was stocked with a blowdryer and all the usual amenities. The staff was helpful when we asked for suggestions/advice. Also, there was a problem with our toilet that was resolved promptly to our satisfaction.Things to note:VALUABLES~There is no in-room safe. If you need to stow something of value you have to use the hotel's safe deposit box. I find this unacceptable for a hotel of this level in Chicago.NOISE~As another reviewer noted, there are MULTIPLE construction projects going on next to the Amalfi. It begins early in the morning until around 6pm, including Saturday mornings.If you want to sleep in past 8am or want a nap during the afternoon you may have problems.FOOD/DRINKS~The continental breakfast and free cocktail hour make this hotel a good value. We saved on breakfast by staying here and enjoyed the &quot;Amalfitini&quot; as our pre-dinner drink. I liked the Amalfi, but I wouldn't return until I knew the construction projects were over since I like to sleep late when I'm on vacation. The entire area where the Amalfi is near would hear the noise, so travelers should research their hotel location carefully if you think the noise will bother you. One of the construction projects was still at ground level, so it'll probably be a long time before the noise ends.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-06-10"}

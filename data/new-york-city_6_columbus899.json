{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Too small to bother", "text": "While the staff was very friendly and service oriented, this was one of the most ridiculous of the 100+ nights I have spent in a NYC hotel! In my first room (which was so small, I hurt myself when I turned around) the telephone didn't work. After 3 visits from the non-English speaking &quot;facilities guy,&quot; the apologetic front desk clerk gave me a new room. While this room was no bigger, at least it didn't look onto the airshaft covered with pigeon droppings. All was well until I returned to my room at 11:00PM and tried to turn on the heat to take the chill off the 60 degree room. No heat. No facilities guy. No other rooms. No luck. While the Sushi restaurant in the lobby is &quot;happening&quot;, it was the only kitchen functioning. Breakfast was stale pastries and lukewarm coffee while room service was a 3-ring binder of NYC delivery services. If you are a fasting Liliputian, this is a great place. Otherwise, go down the street or around the corner.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-01-03"}

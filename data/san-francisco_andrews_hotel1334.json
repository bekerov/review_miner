{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Family Vacation", "text": "We just returned from a visit to San Francisco where we stayed at this quaint, cozy hotel. We arrived before check-in time, eager to explore the city, and Oscar had us in our rooms quickly and efficiently. We had requested a separate room for our teen daughters, and Oscar worked dilligently to put us on the same floor. We actually ended up just one room away. The elevator is small, just enough room for the luggage cart and a couple of people, but we relished the idea of racing it up seven stories. Needless to say, that excitement waned after the first trip up the stairs! The main complaints about the Andrews seem to be the tiny rooms and baths, and the noise. We found the size of the rooms to be adequate for all our needs. We were here to see the city, not to spend time in our rooms. As for the noise, we were on the 7th floor, so street noise wasn't bad. We did here sirens, but since my husband is a firefighter that was a plus for us! Oscar was extremely helpful with suggestions and directions.My husband and I enjoyed our complementary glasses of wine (the girls had Shirley Temples) in the cozy lobby. While we didn't ever get to eat in the hotel restaurant, Fino, it was busy each night and we will try again next time we stay here. The continental breakfast was very nice, especially when someone brings you coffee in bed! (Thanks honey!) Even when we didn't get up at the crack of dawn, there was still coffee and crossants.We don't make it to San Francisco very often, but we'd like to. And when we do go again, we will stay at the Andrews.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-01-04"}

I work in travel and am often given a nice room for the word of mouth, however this trip the room was tiny compared to the first, it was clean but a little shabby. I was told my parking would be covered by a person in sales and when I came the final day to get the car, I was informed that they no longer did that and I would have to pay. I was not prepared for that but did pay. When I went to the hotel they were no help and basically said I could call when she was in on Monday to see what she could do. I was reimbursed however it was a hassle I was not expecting and no help was offered.It is a good location though.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-09-30"}

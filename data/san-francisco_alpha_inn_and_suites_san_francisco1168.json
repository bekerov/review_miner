By time I got home the following day I had over 50 bites on my body. After visits to the doctor, allergist &amp; dermatologist, they were confirmed o be bed bugs and I spent MONTHS taking pills and applying cream to make them go away!! The management did not respond wen I tried to report the situation via email. Go anywhere else!!!!", "hotel": "alpha_inn_and_suites_san_francisco", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-11"}

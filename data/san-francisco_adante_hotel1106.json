{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great little hotel in excellent position", "text": "We stayed here for 3 nights during mid September 2004.We booked our room via an online accommodation website, and was a little concerned after reading some of the negative reviews here and in the Lonely Planet Guide. We were quite surprised and pleased with this location. Yeah, there are a few regular street bums and beggars in the area, but its nothing as bad as the big cities on the East Coast of the USA (i.e. Washington DC). Those with the usual street smarts should have no problems.We arrived late evening of the day of our check in to be told that they were over booked on our room, but proceeded to give us a complimentary upgrade to a king size suite for our first night which was excellent. The remaining two night were back in the actual room we had booked which was quite small, but hey, your in San Fran to experience the city, so our room was just for sleeping. The room was quite old and in need of a renovation overhaul, but it has been clevery disguised with a marine theme paint job and decor.Be forewarned that there is no air conditioning in the rooms, just ceiling fans.The staff were super friendly and there is a coffee shop/internet cafe sharing the lobby area. The breakfast is a bit ordinary, which donuts, muffins, juices and coffee on offer, but there are plenty of alternative eateries in the near area.There is a coin operated laundry across the street, but please note that there is a good chance that a &quot;local&quot; will come in a ask you for a &quot;donation&quot;.Taxis are easy to hail from the street, and its only about $7.60 from the hotel to the Pier 39 tourist area and the ferrys to Alcatraz. For the energetic, its a good walk, but the steep slopes can be quite challenging.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-10-13"}

Well, ivisited the website and it looked fancy and really nice but... when i arrived, it was old, all the stairs creaked and were uneven, the elevator had duct-taped doors (because it was shattered), paints chipped on all surfaces, bedroom windows have no screens (even on 5th and 6th stories up) -NOT SAFE! Nor do they close all the way or lock, tv has at most 3 channels that work. I was also given used toilet paper. The grossest thing was when i found hair on every towel (luckily i had my own in my trunk) and the blankets smelled like cigarettes. Not to mention the bad neighborhood although the HILTON is 2 blocks down as well as Union square. It kinda felt like those apartments from the movie THE PUNISHER. If you have children, be smart, pay a lil more and get a family friendly hotel with service. Also, there were no phones in the rooms. What if theres an emergency or fire?! Will the walls echo my yelling? Needless to say, i slept with my towel over the pillow and on top of my own beach blanket that i always keep in my trunk...cuz you'll just never know when youll need it.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_suites_union_square", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-04-17"}

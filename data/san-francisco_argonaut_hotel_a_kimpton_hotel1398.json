{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "What a nice surprise", "text": "I went to check out this hotel for a business meeting, but would definitely return as a family. This newer property is on the north end of Fisherman's Wharf and has a completely different feel that the busier part of the Wharf. It juts up to a park where the cable cars turn around (but never heard one smidge of cable car noise) and if you are lucky enough to have the view I did (Golden Gate bridge in the distance on one side and Alcatrez on the other) you may never leave your room. I watched birds diving into the bay for fish and tons of exercisers heading out along the bay to run. It is a perfect jumping off location for experiencing the city, while feeling like you aren't smack in the center of a busy city.The hotel itself is also very nice. The nautical theme is just on this side of too much, but it seems to work. The rooms are large and clean, the bathrooms nice. The onsite restaurant has award winning chowders that were wonderful.Like I said...a very nice surprise. Definitely check it out. (And splurge on the Bay view.)", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-05"}

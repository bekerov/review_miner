{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "clean budget hotel", "text": "Just returned and thought the folks at the Adante deserved some well earned praise. Exceptionally clean rooms, everything was quite spotless. The rooms were a little small, we ( a family of 4 with 10,12 year olds) were a little squashed, but not horribly. We got upgraded to their junior suite and the kids did fine in the pull out sofa. I always do a spot inspection when getting to a hotel ( toilets, lights, tv, etc) and this place passed wonderfully. We stayed for four nights, got a late c/o and still paid only $500.US. total. That qualifies as a good bargain in San Fran. Nobody mentioned that there was a laundry mat next door for families with kids. The free muffins in the morning were tasty, and the oj was a nice touch. Staff were pleasant and helpful, a great place that was certainly a great deal. Well done, Adante !!", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-05-23"}

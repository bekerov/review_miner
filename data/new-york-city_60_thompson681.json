{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "uniformly good service", "text": "I have stayed in NYC each of the last 10 years for my annual photographic trip. In recent years i have moved down from midtown and stayed in Soho at the Mercer and Soho Grand. This time i went with my family to 60 Thompson. The hotel is excellently positioned for the immediate area and lower Manhattan yet in a quiet road. It's rooms are bigger than most but whilst I believe service levels in most NYC hotels are better than the uk, 60 Thompson was exceptional. One felt relaxed and at ease. I can also recommend the City Girl Cafe across the road for a great coffee and the Thom bar if you're feeling sociable.The only minor quibble is that the roof terrace was closed for the season which was disappointing as i had planned to take photos, but it's only a minor point.If you want a very comfortable, classy and not overtly trendy base with extremely helpful and friendly staff for exploring the less touristy lower Manhattan then this hotel fits the bill.Simon 49", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-27"}

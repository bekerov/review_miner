{"city": "chicago", "title": "Allerton not so great!", "text": "Rooms very well decorated and we were upgraded to a suite but there was no coffeemaker, minibar, bottled water or microwave. Doorbell to our room rang every few hours all night also fan in bathroom VERY loud and could not be shut off, did not get much sleep the two nights we were there! Staff very nice and friendly which was one of the few good points.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-03-15"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "A Great Place to Stay ", "text": "I stayed at 70 Park Ave. Hotel for 4 nights. The staff throughout the hotel were friendly, and responsive to my needs. They made my trip a very memorable one. My room was clean, well cared for and easy to access. The evening wine social was extremely nice and very good after a day of work and lots of walking. A great wat to unwind. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in NYC who wants a 4-5 star hotel with a rating of 4.0 or better out of 5 in survey responses. Thank you 70 Park Ave Hotel staff for such a great stay!", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-03"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "The Abbott has improved a LOT!", "text": "I stayed at the Abbott this month, it was not my first time there, but I was very glad to see that they had improved a lot: new beds and carpets, a comfortable lobby, and no roaches any more! (I saw only one, in a dustbin). The location is superb, close to 24-hour restaurants and stores, as well as a subway station and plenty of buses! Chicago is a rather expensive city, so it is a real pleasure to find this little gem, with friendly neighbours and very friendly and professional staff. (Also, the air conditionning is great, particularly during these hot summer months).", "hotel": "abbott_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-08-16"}

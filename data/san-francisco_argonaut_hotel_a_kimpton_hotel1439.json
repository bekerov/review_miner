{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "a view would be nice!", "text": "Only stayed here two nights. Wish it could have been longer as we love San Francisco. Have stayed at both the Holiday Inns in the past, but decided to treat ourselves to the Argonaut after all its great reviews.After a bit of a mix up when the receptionist thought we'd only reserved one room instead of two, we were pleasantly surprised to find we were entitled to breakfast on the two mornings.It was only juice, tea or coffee, a bowl of fruit and a choice of pastry or toast but it was all right for nothing. The complementary wine in the evening was a nice touch even though we didn't like the wine. The rooms were very smart and actually looked like the photos on the hotel web site. Internet was free in the room , something other hotels should consider in this day and age.My only gripe was that our view was over a courtyard to rooms with shutters at the windows which ,sort of, made me think of Alcatraz!I think you have to pay extra for any decent view.The cost of the valet carparking is rather extortionate, but so was that at both Holiday Inns. Can certainly recommend this hotel for its good points and excellent locality and would definitely go back, but would try to get a better room ( with a view )next time.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-26"}

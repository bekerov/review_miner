{"city": "chicago", "title": "Absolutely loved this hotel", "text": "We stayed at the amafi for 4 nights in Feb. It was fantastic. From the minute we arrived at reception, the girl at the desk was so friendly. The room was really testefully decorated. I also loved the really soft bath robe and slippers provided and also the safe in the wardrobe was useful. The double shower head was great as was the mirror with the light on it for doing my make-up( something i hadn't seen in other hotels).The location was perfect for us. The complimentary bar between 5 and 7 pm is nice. we met some very friendly people therewe only went 2 evening out of 4 but always enjoyed it. i must admit i was surprised to hear that breakfast was a buffet opposite the lifts!! the first 2 mornings were fine, we had a good breakfast, i sneaked from the room in my bathrobe and luckily no one spotted me ha ha. the 3rd and 4th morning when i went there the best of the breakfast goodies were gone because there was a conference onin the city and the hotel was booked up so you need to get to the buffet early!Over all we had a fantastic time here and we will most definately be saying here next time xx", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-29"}

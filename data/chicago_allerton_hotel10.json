{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great location ", "text": "This is a great location, in terms of shopping and seeing the most attractive part of downtown Chicago. The hotel itself is relatively inexpensive for this part of town and for overall quality. There are a few aspects of the place that are a drawback, as has been noted in prior reviews. First, the place is hampered by its inadequate elevators. Even though it has five, you find yourself waiting a fair amount, including just getting to the lobby from the street level. Second, the rooms can be small. I had a corner room on the 11th floor, which measured roughly 9 x 11, leaving little room beyond that taken by the bed and desk. There was virtually no drawer space, and the closet and bathroom were also tight. For one person, it was acceptable, in a European/sailboat kind of way. The room itself was nicely done, with fairly good quality bedding and finishes. In talking with other guests, I got the impression that other rooms were somewhat larger, though not expansive.As for other aspects, breakfast was an anemic buffet priced at $15.00. The hotel has a large workout area on the top floor.Overall, I think the Allerton is a fairly good option, especially at the price.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-16"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Perfect for our needs and a great deal!", "text": "We stayed at the Allerton on 6/30/06 for a nearby wedding, just for one night, so we weren't looking for anything but a place to crash. We were pleasantly surprised with the Allerton...we booked through Priceline and for the first time tried the 'name your own price' deal. We had looked high and low on several websites and couldn't come up with a room for under $200...so we took our chances and after bidding for a room for $80, they gave us the Allerton. It was great! The staff was very nice and also helpful - we pulled our car up to the entrance for parking and went inside, where a very helpful staff member directed us to the 3rd floor lobby and wished us an enjoyable stay. At check in, we asked for a king bed and were told, &quot;not a problem at all&quot;. The lobby was very nice, and while the hallways and elevators were somewhat small, it seemed quaint. We were given a room at the end of a hall (room 1502) which was very nice...king bed, two TV's, couch/sitting area, desk, etc. The bed was kind of squeezed in there, but the sitting area made up for it. The bathroom was a bit small... that didn't bother us, but there was not much space to put your toiletries. It is also the best location...right on Michigan avenue by Water Tower and all the great shopping and restaurants. We only wish we had more time to enjoy the area! Hope this info helps!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-05"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Does exactly what it says on the tin", "text": "I have just come back from San Francisco. I stayed at the Adante hotel for 10 nights with my girlfriend and we don't have a single complaint about it. The hotel is clean, the rooms are cleaned everyday. The staff are friendly and helpful. Our toilet got blocked while we were there and we informed the front desk of this as we were leaving for a bite to eat. When we returned to our room the problem had been resolved. The hotel is is at the start of part of town called The tenderloin which has a lot of homeless people walking around. Although it could get a little bothersome being asked for change every 2 minutes walking around the area back to the hotel, not once did i have a problem with those people. They just ask and you walk on by. So i felt pretty safe there and didn't feel threatened at any time. I have read other reviews before i went where people have said the rooms smelled and what not. This is not my experience at all. Others said the decor of the rooms was bad. Well, why don't they stay at the Hilton then.I don't know anyone who goes on holiday to stay in their hotel room. I went to see San Francisco, not 4 walls of a room. If you want to see the city, the Adante is great.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-07-31"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Adquete for the trip", "text": "This is an older hotel situated near the north end of the Magnificent mile. The rooms have been updated but don't expect a huge room by any means. The hotel itself is nice enough. If you're coming or going during what I call 'prime' times you will experience a long delay at the elevators. Note: Only one elevator is qualified as handicap ready. For business travelers I was only able to fine one free socket at the desk provided. There were additional plugs near the closet, but what was really missing is additional plugs near the desk. The free WiFi in the hotel (only in the meeting rooms and lobby) was painfully slow. The $10/day charge for in the room wired was reasonable. One more item of note. Parking per day with in/out rights were $51. Unless you had a really specific need I highly suggest that you take a cab to the hotel and make use of the public transport in the area.The staff is present, but I wouldn't say overly helpful. Even with a 3 PM check in time I had to wait an additional 30 mins for a room, and that's only because I asked them about it. This is what in my opinion stopped it from being a 4 star hotel.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-13"}

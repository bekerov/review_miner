{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Bad service", "text": "The clerk at the counter refused to check us in because the guest who had occupied the room wanted to extend his stay for another night. They could not offer us another room (fully booked) instead we should stay at the Hudson hotel a hundred yards down the road for one night and come back the next day for the second night. We refused and asked for the manager in charge to complain about this unacceptable offer, but the clerk was the manager already. The manager emphasized that the Hudson had the same standard (that was a lie, as we found out later) and we could stay there for two nights. We did not like to spoil our holiday and accepted the change.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-14"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Not Great!", "text": "I'm from Chicago and I go back to visit frequently. I've stayed at various mid-range hotels downtown and this one ranks on the bottom of my list. First off, I was traveling with a female co-worker this time. I booked 4 months in advance and had called several times requesting a room with two beds. I was told I had to make that request at check in. Well, low and behold they only had rooms with one bed. We weren't too happy and when this was mentioned, the guy at check-in seemed flippant and replied, &quot;Well, I can't give you what I don't have.&quot; The hotel and the room were clean but small and this particular room had a nice view of the fire escape. The other issue I had was their elevator system. It's an old building and while the entrance was street level, one has to take an elevator to the third floor to reach the main elevators to the rooms. The elevators are VERY slow and very small. With 23 floors of guests waiting to get upstairs, it's a rat race to get to the elevator first--or be stuck standing there as long as 5 min to get up to your room. All that said, the Allerton's saving grace is it's location--on Michagan Avenue's Magnificant Mile. As a tourist, it's a wonderful area to stay--walking distance to Oak Street Beach at one end and the Chicago river and on to business dist. of downtown at the other. Chicago is a wonderful city to be &quot;out and about&quot; in. If you're only using the Allerton as a place to rest your head, it'll be adequate. For the same price, I much prefer the Palmer House Hilton. It's a couple stops further on the subway but it's beautiful.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-20"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "A little below average", "text": "The good thing about this hotel is location. It's right on Magnificent Mile (Michigan Avenue) so if you like shopping, this may be the right one. However, The Allerton Hotel did not meet my expectation at all. I booked a double junior suite and expected to get a nice, if not, a quite nice room. Turned out, the room was pretty ugly looking. The wall was painted yellow. Mind you it's not the yellow you see in the photo gallery on the hotel's website. If you really want to see how your room would look like, check out the hotel's virtual tour. It looks the closest to the real thing. The staff were ok. Though, the concierge was excellent.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-30"}

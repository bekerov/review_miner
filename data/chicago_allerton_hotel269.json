{"city": "chicago", "title": "perfect", "text": "the hotel is right in the middle of the magic mile. near the lake, countless restaurants, the hancock building (highly recommend for night viewing), and other attractions all within walking distance. also very near to the train. the staff was courteous, and quite helpful with assistance and local info--especially the bellmen. the hotel was beautiful. our room was quite small, just big enough for the bed, small desk, and tv, but it was still very nice, and we had a view of the water from our window. my only regret--bringing a car. you don't need one here, and it's $20-35 per day to park anywhere downtown. next time i'll fly, and i'll be back to the allerton.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-04-05"}

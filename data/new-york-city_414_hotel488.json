Unfortunately, I stayed in a room on the first floor and the window lock was broken. The staff was apologetic and assured me that security camera's were in use and that I was completely safe. The room faced the back courtyard making it accessable to other guests plus anyone willing to jump the fence and push the screen in. I would not stay here again.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-28"}

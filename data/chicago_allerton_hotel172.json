{"city": "chicago", "title": "Style and Convenience", "text": "I stayed in this wonderful historic hotel whilst attending a conference there. The hotel is located very centrally, midway along the golden mile of shopping. The hotel is comfortable, the rooms a good size (for a hotel of this vintage) and the staff polite and helpful.My only gripe is that guests are expected to pay extra for wi-fi access in their rooms - surely a hotel of this standing shouldn't be doing this as the additional cost to the hotel is minimal!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-07-27"}

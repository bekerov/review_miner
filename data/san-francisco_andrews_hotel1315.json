{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great service by Oscar Morales", "text": "For the price we paid, Andrews Hotel is value for money. It's centrally located and the service by their assistant manger Oscar Morales is very personal - He knows your name and greets you whenever you enter the lobby. The breakfast is great and the afternoon wine (FREE!) is a nice way to relax in the lobby. The rooms are small but cosy, yes the toliet may be a bit small but you can't have the best of everything. You can also borrow DVDs for free at the reception. There are parking lots behind the hotel, but it doesn't come cheap. Anyway, parking in San Francisco is not cheap!", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-12-02"}

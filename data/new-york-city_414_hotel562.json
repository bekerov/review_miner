{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Ok in good location", "text": "We stayed 2 nights on our way from San Fancisco back to Europe. Once you are over the shock of Manhatten hotel.prices I guess this hotel is not too bad. The room was small with a huge plasma telly. Our room was clean, though other guests seem to had encounters with arthropodic favourites. The guy at reception was with very few words. The bath was ok, though the water was only luke warm. The main plus for this place is the location, 2 min to restaurant row and less than 10 min to time square on foot. Also good, free internet access in lobby.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-11-27"}

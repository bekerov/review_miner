{"city": "chicago", "title": "Disgusting", "text": "The good: Excellent locationThe bad:When I checked into my room, the room had two windows and no window shades or curtains. There was no way to block the light from the street or to have any privacy. The brackets were there for the blinds..they just weren't there.I contacted housekeeping and maintenance and they said they would look for some shades but it would take a long time and even then they probably didn't have any.I then went to the front desk to change rooms. The non somking room they gave me smelled like an ashtry. I went back down to the front desk to tell them about the smell and the clerk told me that it was impossible that the room smelled of smoke since it was a non smoking room. Interesting logic but not a good answer. Her solution was to have housekeeping come up and spray perfume all over the room. Again, not a good solution. So since the hotel was allegedly sold out I went back to the non smelly room with no shades.I called maintenence again and they brought the shades.Unfortunately, the shades were yellow from nicotine and again smelled unbeliveably bad. So I suffered through the night smelling my disgusting shades.Customer service in this hotel is nil and the facilties are going down hill fast.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-16"}

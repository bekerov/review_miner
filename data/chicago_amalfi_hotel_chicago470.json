{"city": "chicago", "title": "Location: great Hotel: very average", "text": "If you visit the website for the Amalfi Hotel it will give you a set of expectations this hotel simply can't fulfil. Having been to many Chicago hotels, this one is smack dab in the middle. It is not as nice as the Park Hyatt, Westin Michigan Avenue, Sofitel, Burnham or the like. It is about the same quality as the Hyatt Regency or the Radisson on Huron. The problem is that the rooms and common areas are very reminiscent of a bit of an upscale Holiday Inn. Again, it's one of those hotels that try to create something really interesting out of a very average, plain foundation. The location is fantastic, really. Right between Michigan and State, right on the cusp of River North and south of the river. You couldn't ask for a better location. The hotel is loud. Soundproofing in the rooms needs work. The gym is okay, but not great. So, in sum, this is not a bad hotel but it shouldn't be the first place you look for a Chicago room.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-06-04"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Mixed feelings", "text": "I was very afraid to stay here, based on the reviews I had read. But I have to say the experience was overall good. I think that the owners of the hotel know that because of it's very good location, people will overlook it's shortcomings, and some of these are serious. For starters, the front desk employees need to get rid of their attitude. I supose they are tired of receiving so many complaints, and having little o no power to fix things. Also, the dinning room is depressing, I am surprised the decorator thought of it as inviting. No wonders it was always empty!!!!!The elevators, at first you find them funny, but after a couple of rides, the story is different.Now, the good stuff. LOCATION!!!There is no much to add to that. The entrance being just a few feet from Michigan Avenue, it is the perfect place to start a shopping spree!. And with the money you save staying here (coz the prices are low!!) you can extend your stay. The beds are comfy!! and yes, the rooms are very (VERY) small, but, if you are in a wonderful city like Chicago, why would you want to spend long hours in the hotel?Soaps from L'Occitane.. that is nice, and after a long visit to the Chicago Art Instiitute, you would certainly appreciate a bath or long shower.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-02"}

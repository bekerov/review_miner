{"city": "chicago", "title": "Greatest staff we have encountered in a long time.", "text": "Enjoyed this Hotel immensely, possibly the best and most accomodating staff of any Hotel we have stayed at recently.Checked in for New Years Eve for 2 nights, we were given a corner room , nice size comfortable but a bit noisy from some outside fans. Contacted the front desk and they responded immediately , personally came to our room to show us another availability and moved us to a beautiful suite overlooking Harry Carey's. Everyone went out of the way to make our stay comfortable and arrange dining and theatre tickets. They work closley with Harry Carey's and walked in without a reservation at 7:00 PM New years eve, gave them a card from the Hotel and we were seated immediately. Tuan the bellman, Joe, Chris and George at the front desk were wonderful.The evening cocktail party had great food and beverage selection, the morning continental breakfast on each floor had great selection as well", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-01-02"}

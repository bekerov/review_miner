We enjoyed its convenient location and small size. We arrived early in the morning and were able to leave our luggage in a corner of the lobby so that we could tour around for the day. When we arrived at check in our luggage had been moved to our room which was quite nice considering there are a lot of stairs. Our room was clean &amp; comfortable though a bit small and was perfect since we did not come to NYC to stay in our room a lot. It was a great place to relax for a bit after walking, shopping and touring in the city. We would definitely consider staying here again!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-01-09"}

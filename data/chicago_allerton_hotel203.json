{"city": "chicago", "title": "Rooms like closets", "text": "When we arrived at 3pm, we were told that the room was not ready. However, if we wanted a smaller room, we could check in immediately. We decided to wait for the larger room and were told it would be ready in about 1 hour. 1 hour later, we went back but were told that it would take some more time. Half an hour later, we were given our room keys. Even after all this wait, this was a very small room. There was barely enough space in the room for the full bed. We were told by the front desk that all the rooms were small. However, looking at the floor layout (near the elevators for fire safety) as well as talking to others who were staying there, we got the smallest room on the floor. Also, they do not make up the rooms until 3-4pm every day during our stay.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-14"}

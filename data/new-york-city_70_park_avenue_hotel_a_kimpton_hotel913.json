{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "good but not up to Kimpton standards", "text": "I've stayed in a number of Kimpton hotels and generally like them. The service at Kimpton hotels is generally very good, and 70 Park is consistent with this. The hotel has a small footprint and, for example, the elevators are small and somewhat slow, the lobby is smallish etc. Where 70 Park gets lower grades is on its overall appearance. As noted in several reviews, the place has a bit of a rundown feeling, the carpets and fixtures are worn, the rooms seem in need of sprucing up. Room rate was pretty good on promotion ($280/night), and the location is great, so not at all bad (I would give it sort of a 3.5 out of 5). I might be inclined to try a newer Kimpton property in NYC if I could get roughly the same rate.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-08"}

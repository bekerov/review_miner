{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Nice location", "text": "Ok hotel, excellent location, great price... enjoyed my stay here. Only a 7 minute walk to Fisherman's wharf, and a very nice staff. Nice rooms with lots of cable channels... Only bad thing was that the light switches would not work upon returning from the day. Called up front, they sent a man to fix it within minutes, but never got them working. At least the lamps worked! But other than that it was a pleasant stay and very convenient (we never had to take the car out!)", "hotel": "america_s_best_inn_san_francisco", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-07-23"}

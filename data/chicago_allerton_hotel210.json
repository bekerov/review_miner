{"city": "chicago", "title": "Never Again!", "text": "Hi We just stayed here July 28 and July 29th. I will start by saying the location is great. It is in the heart of magnificent mile. As you enter the hotel at the ground level. There are 2 elevators, a couple of chairs, and a desk. The man at the desk was very unfriendly and said check in is on the 3rd floor. You than take the SMALL elevator to the third floor for check in. We had booked on Priceline. This is my second time booking on Priceline and both times in both hotels we got rooms directly across from the elevator? Is it a coincidence or punishment for booking on Priceline :)After checking in we than had to catch another elevator to our room. The elevators are among the slowest and smallest in the country. Each time we took the elevator the wait was over 15 minutes. I KNEW it was a bad sign when we entered the room and there were earplugs, a soothing music CD, and eye patches on the bed!!! Room was very small. We had breakfast there one morning. Super expensive.There are tons of hotels around. Go eles where!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-08-02"}

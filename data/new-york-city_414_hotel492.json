{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great hotel", "text": "I found this hotel on tripadvisor and it received great reviews. Well here's another :-)....My boyfriend and I LOVED it. Our room was quaint &amp; contemporary. We loved the clock w/the iPod connector. The bed and pillows were awesome, we got a great night's sleep. The only complaint we have is we were awaken@7am by dishes clinking and the lobby chairs scraping across the floor when they were setting up for the free continental breakfast [which continued until it was over at 10] {very disturbing when we got in late Saturday night, and planned on sleeping in} Outside of that, it was great. I'll just request a room not on the 1st floor for our next visit b/c this won't be our last stay@the 414.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-30"}

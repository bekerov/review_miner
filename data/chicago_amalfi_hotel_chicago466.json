Hotel was very nice - quiet, but still plenty of young people and an energetic vibe. It's in a good location - actually close to Michigan Ave (the previous person obviously did not know that you can walk a different way and be there in five mins), yet still within the Rush St. area that has good bars and restaurants. Don't miss the burgers at Harry Caray's. Also, the Weber Steakhouse was very good. Best place of all was the Billy Goat Tavern. Anyone who appreciates SNL (&quot;cheezborger, cheezborger&quot;) will love it - it has not changed in the seventy years it has been sitting there. Very cool place and great burgers.Amalfi was just what we needed. Nice, clean, professional...", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-17"}

Also, the rooms are very, very small. I mean small, as in closet with windows. When I stayed in one of the &quot;king&quot; rooms, the sink was in my lap when I sat on the toilet. There are many other (better) choices in this neighborhood, like the Metropolis or the Cosmo even.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-11-05"}

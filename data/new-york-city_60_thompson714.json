{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great location good service average rooms", "text": "We stayed at 60 Thompson from a Thursday to a Sunday. We had an early flight &amp; arrived at 10am. Our room happened to be ready which was a bonus. The room itself was average, small and slightly worn looking. There were traces of the last guests - a letter left on the dresser, water in the ice bucket, but the bed appeared to have been changed &amp; overall the room was very clean. If you are planning to use the room for business, there is no desk. Our only major problem was the noise on the Saturday night. Not the hotel's fault - we happened to be next to a very rowdy room who was smashing doors &amp; yelling most of the night. As with most boutique hotels the sound proofing just isn't there &amp; even during the other days &amp; nights we could clearly hear flushing toilets in other rooms, speaking &amp; closing of doors. The hotel is in a great location and the staff is exceptionally friendly. Would we stay again? For that price we will probably look for another hotel close by.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-06"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "An Excellent find! Highly Recommended", "text": "This hotel is brilliant - just what is needed if sightseeing or on business. The rooms are cosy and modern, the bed is to die for, I found it hard to get up in the morning. The large plasma screen at the foot of the bed is a bonus and the hospitality first class. Staff are very helpful particularly Greg who knows just about everything there is to know about New York. Refreshments are available all day free of charge and the breakfast is basic but is very fresh and healthy. The location is great - Hell's Kitchen at the end of the road, a few blocks to Times Square, Broadway and good shopping Couldn't have wished for a better location.I highly recommend this hotel, it's perfect for all types of travellers, although not enough space for children perhaps, the court yard area is sweet and captures the real essence of a New York outside space, the building has character and there is a real charm to it. We will definately stay here again.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-03-08"}

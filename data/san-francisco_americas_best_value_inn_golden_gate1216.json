{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Keep your expectations low.", "text": "Booked this hotel from New Zealand and were a little nervous after reading some bad reviews but when we arrived we were pleasantly surprised with the place. We had no car so had no problems with parking, although I think that probably not the best place for those with cars. Bed was big and comfortable, although the room had no extra amenities like fridge kettle etc. Bathroom was clean and shower was good, and TV service was great. Located in a great part of town close to Fisherman's Wharf and great restaurants. Also perfectly situated for those who are game enough to use public transport. Buses run frequently from almost directly outside to many parts of town including Haight, and the park and bridge etc. Probably more recommended for younger budget travellers and those with an open mind. As I said, keep your expectations low and you wont be disappointed.PS.. avoid the breakfast (a small prepackaged Danish) and head to ihop across the road. The stuffed french toast is mint.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-02"}

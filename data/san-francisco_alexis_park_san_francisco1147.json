{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Clean motel in lousy area", "text": "I agree with the other reviews that the room was clean and well maintained. However, it is located in a terrible neighborhood. There are hundreds of homeless people within a three to four block radius of the motel. It was very uncomfortable walking outside after dark. San Francisco is a beautiful city if you are in the right area, but this isn't the neighborhood to spend your vacation.", "hotel": "alexis_park_san_francisco", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-09-29"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Perfect New York hotel", "text": "We booked this hotel on quikbook.com at an unbelievable rate of $270/night, 2 or 3 nights before our arrival. Everything else we looked at was over $300. And this turned out to be the best place we've ever stayed in in New York. Our room was called a Pod Room, which means there is a bedroom and bathroom. No seating area and no desk! But we're never in the room anyway, so it was perfect. As you can see by the many photos here, the rooms are clean, stylish, modern. We loved that there is a Starbucks right next door, and the Columbus Circle subway station, a major subway stop with many intersecting lines, is right across the street! It's across the street from the Time Warner Center for high-end shopping. All this, plus the low rate, adds up to a perfect New York hotel.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-12"}

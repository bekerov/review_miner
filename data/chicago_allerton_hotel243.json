{"city": "chicago", "title": "Good location but the hotel's a dump", "text": "If you are a tourist, this is a great location. That is the only good thing I can say about this place. Check in was very slow. I reserved a nonsmoking room. When I got there, they did not have one, and they did not seem to care very much - so they gave me a smoking room. When I went to the room, it had not been made up and was in disgusting condition. So I came back downstairs and after another 15 minute delay, they gave me another room that had been made up. The room was very small (half the size of a usual hotel room). The bathroom was also very small - so small it is hard to move around in. And it had only one towel in it. The elevators were small and cramped and slow. The room price was $260 a night. (maybe you could get cheaper; I booked on short notice). It was basically Motel 6 quality at Ritz Carlton prices. I would not stay here again. There are a lot of very nice hotels in Chicago in that price range. If you want a MUCH better hotel in the same location, try the Fitzpatrick - a friendly hotel with very nice rooms, good staff and excellent Irish bar in the basement.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-15"}

There is free continental breakfast in the common area (or on the back patio) in the morning, and a friendly vibe that makes this place unpretentious and comfortable.By NY standards the room was decent sized,. Other must-haves these days were present: bathroom was good, good sized TV, free wireless, lots of plugs and windows that open! Two downsides1. no restaurant...but lots only steps away.2. no elevator...having had neck surgery not too long ago I had to ask for someone to carry my bag up and down. Not a big deal though.Definitely worth checking out.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-26"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Stayed March 20-24 and can't wait to return.", "text": "We chose to stay in Six Columbus because of the great location and reviews found here at TripAdvisor. I would recc. this hotel to those looking to explore the city and indulge themselves at a boutique hotel.The hotel was very clean and the staff was quite helpful and courteous. The location is top notch directly across from the shops at Columbus Circle which houses a Whole Foods which is perfect for a tasty and inexpensive breakfast. Next door to the hotel is Starbucks, a bit further you will find a Duane Reade and Dunkin Donuts. You will find Central Park 2 minutes away and Times Square is a quick 12-15 minute walk from the hotel. Many subways are literally found right outside the front door of the hotel.We had a weak wireless internet signal that was not protected, minimal noise from inside or outside the hotel, newspaper each morning and the best mini-bar and snacks I've ever seen. Our room was a good size - Queen superior and loads of space for all of our luggage.The few downsides we noticed were:The heater did not heat up the room (I wanted 82 and it would only reach 69). I had to sleep with a hoodie on for two nights to keep warm. We notified the front desk twice and upon check out we were told it was a problem within the entire hotel and they were working on it.Very strange that the cleaning staff NEVER left the right amount of towels - not even when we checked in. First day no hand towels, then no face towels, then again no hand towels. Very strange, but housekeeping quickly bought up the towels when requested.Lastly, we could not get a seat in the bar or dining area on the two nights we tried. Yes, we could have called ahead, but as a guest at any other hotel I've stayed in this has never been a cause for concern.Even with the few downsides, I'd stay here again.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-02"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Pretty good for the price", "text": "The room was clean and nice, but it was a little bit noisy. It's not very big, but it's nice if just sleep there. The guys at the reception were helpful. The breakfast was a dissapointment. They said there's going to be muffins and fruits and everything, but instead there were only toasts and jam. It was kind of boring after 5 mornings... The location is pretty good. The cable car line is close to it and u can also walk to attractions. There is a bus stop just in front of the hotel.But it's right on the edge of the good area.If u turn to the right from the hotel it kind of gets creepy and u just simply don't wan't to walk further.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-03"}

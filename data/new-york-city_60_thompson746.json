{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Super Cool 60 Thompson", "text": "My fiance and I stayed 2 nights in the 60 Thompson in the last week in May 2006 and it is definitely the place to be.We stayed in a deluxe double which was comfortable and clean with a massive flat screen TV, fully stocked mini bar and some lovely toiletries in the bathroom.The hotel has a guests only, roof top bar which has some fantastic views over the Manhattan skyline. You can clearly see the Empire State building and watching the sunset from here is truly idyllic. The hotel is slap bang in the middle of Soho which is teeming with trendy bars, resturants and boutique shops. It is also within walking distance of the Spring Street subway and Broadway and the shopping is great so have your credit card handy!This hotel, however, will always have a special place in my heart as my boyfriend chose the hotel's roof top bar to propose to me. The hotel staff, who were in on the secret, were great. They brought champagne and generally treated us like royalty. We finished our evening in a small resturant across the street from the hotel called the Country Cafe. The lady who ran the place was lovely and when she heard our news, she promptly brought more champagne!The concierge service downstairs was invaluable as after a hard days shopping, you can forget wading through the guide book for a nice place to eat. They can recommend some great local places and fill you in what's happening locally. They also helped us out with transport back to the airport.The hotel also has its own resturant but we did not eat here. It also has a bar called Thom which is open to the public and is supposed to be very highly rated (we didn't actually go as we spent our evenings on the roof top.)No breakfast included in the price but there are delis a plenty in the local area and a great pizza place, Ben's Pizza, at the top of the street.A great place to stay.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-05-30"}

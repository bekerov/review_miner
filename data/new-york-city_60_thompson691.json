{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Nothing special", "text": "I've just returned from a weekend at 60 Thompson from my husband and to be honest we were a little disappointed.The roof terrace was closed for refurb opening sometime later in May, not a huge issue but a shame.Firstly, we had originally booked a room that was 1 up from a standard. When we arrived in our room, i was really shocked as to how small it was - you couldn't swing a cat. The room was quite drab with no character whatsover. We stayed in that room for 1 night then upgraded to a bigger room. Much more spacious but again, I don't think it was value for money. This is a 'no frills' hotel as far as I'm concerned. There are many more 'boutique' hotels in NYC that would offer much more.Location is great. We ate in the restaurant. Great food, but i felt they rushed us to be honest.Bit of a hit and miss too with the staff. I called up at 1am for some tampax, the receptionist said she'd get back to me, never did. I just thought a phone call even to say they couldn't help would have been nice. We only stayed in the bar for about 15 minutes. It was really loud and buzzy but can't really comment further than that.Some area's of the hotel are shabby too.Toilets flush is so loud that it sounds like the loo is going to take off!!! All in all, not a hotel to rave on about. I think i'd recommend it for dinner, but not way would i ever stay there again.Hope this helps!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-07"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "A delightful stay at 414", "text": "We recently spent 3 nights at the 414 Hotel on West 46th St. Our room was very clean with ample room. The bathroom was spotless and good sized. We were in the back building, giving us a quiet location. The hotel is among many small restaurants serving different types of food. It is also conveniently located to theaters in the Times Square area. Working at the front desk were Jessica and Mike. Both were extremely helpful and friendly. While the breakfast was not fancy, the cereal, croissants, muffins, sweet rolls, juice and coffee were fresh daily. We would definitely consider staying at the 414 Hotel on future visits to New York City.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-11-21"}

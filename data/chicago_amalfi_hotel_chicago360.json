{"city": "chicago", "title": "great for the price", "text": "Let's get one thing straight - this hotel does not compare to a place like the ritz carleton or even sofitel. Five star here means it was excellent for the price. In booking a hotel for a long weekend at the height of chicago tourist season which had to be right downtown - i looked at the James, Hotel Sax, and some other boutique hotels but the amalfi had the best price so I booked it (despite some spotty reviews on this site). I was happily surprised. The staff was excellent - friendly and knowledgeable. the location ideal (but construction site across the street might be noisy during the week, but was quiet on the weekend). Hotel was extemely clean - no complaints there. Happy hour was great idea, but the room where the drinks were served didn't have windows and felt a bit like an uncomfortable cocktail party, but for the price (free!) there was good food and even some top shelf cocktails. Room was maybe a bit smaller than most, but was comfortable. All in all, a great place where i will definitely stay again.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-06-17"}

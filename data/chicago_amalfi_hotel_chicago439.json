{"city": "chicago", "title": "Better than average but not great", "text": "The Amalfi was a splurge for us for a weekend getaway. We were very excited about the hotel after reading about it online. Maybe our expectations were too high, but we were a little disappointed with our stay. We had mixed experiences w/ the &quot;experience technicians&quot; (i.e. front desk staff). The woman who checked us in was almost done w/ her training but was completely clueless about something basic I asked about. Later, though, our request for toothpaste was happily fulfilled and someone else was extremely helpful with directions via public transporation to a restaurant. I expected to be greeted upon coming and going, but this happened only about half the time (most consistently the concierge staff would greet us). The highly-touted manager's reception took place in a windowless conference room, which definitely detracted from the experience. That said, the drinks we got both nights were good and the finger food decent. Breakfast on every floor was nice, but the bagels were not good at all. It would've been nice to have a selection of cold cereal.Sheets were of very high quality. Bed was too soft for my partner but I liked it. The toilet squeaked when you got up (we never bothered to report it). The bathroom was HUGE, which was nice. I liked the yellow towels; my partner did not. We both agreed that the ones we had at home were softer and more luxurious. Curved shower rod was cool. Aveda products nice, and there was a &quot;vanity kit&quot; and mending kit too. We liked that there were robes and slippers (though oddly only one pair). DVD/CD player played through the TV speakers, so the quality was not good for music. Having a few books and magazines provided was nice. I really liked the comfy chair w/ ottoman, and there was a sliding table that was convenient.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-04-08"}

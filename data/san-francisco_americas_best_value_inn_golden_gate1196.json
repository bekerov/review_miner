{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Don't stay here", "text": "This place was horrible. It had a bad smell to it the paint was chipping in big clumps off the walls. There were spider webs in the room. Housekeeping does not do there job well. My tub still had hair in it from the last person and there was mold on the top of the tub. The next day I had to go get toliet paper and towels because they were not re-stocked. The manager acted like he could care less. My headboard was constently hitting the wall it was not nailed down. I complained but it wasen't fixed, and the best part is the toliet didn't flush well. The manager refused to give back any of my money and he still has money held on my card from check out. I wouldn't stay here again if somebody paid me to.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-09"}

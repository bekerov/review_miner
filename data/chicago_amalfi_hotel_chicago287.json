{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great central Chicago hotel", "text": "We spent 3 enjoyable nights recovering from out jet lag in Amalfi Hotel Chicago. The hotel had just what we were looking for - central location, good comfort in large rooms and a reasonable rate. The hotel has a TV and DVD player, and the reception will lend you movies on request. When the dry cleaners were closed for bank holiday, the hotel staff washed our clothes for free! Our only concern was that a previous guest seemed to have been sick over the upper part of the bathroom door, something the cleaners had failed to notice.There are several restaurants just a block away, and those we checked out were all good.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-11"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "great stay in New York at the 6", "text": "I stayed at this hotel on July 25 and 26, 2008. The hotel is located at 8th Ave. and 58th St. across the circle from Columbus Circle and the Time Warner Center. I upgraded my room from a pod to a queen for an extra $35 a night. This made the rate more than I would have liked to pay as I had read posts where the rate was much better than I got but for New York it was a fair price. The front desk staff was very pleasant and helpful and great to deal with. The room was bigger than at the Hudson down the block but not really big. It was very well designed and pleasing to the eye if a bit dark. The bathroom was shiny and very modern with the right amount of room. The linens and towels were of an excellent quality and the bed was very comfortable. Everything was very clean. I would definitely book here again if I can get a good rate as the location is ideal.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-01"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Wow- not what I expected at all. Two thumbs WAY down.", "text": "My fiance and I have stayed at other Kimpton hotels (In NYC, we have stayed at the Muse and the service was impeccable), but 70 Park Ave is not up to par. Things that were a major inconvenience:1. The air conditioner in our room was not as cool as we anticipated. Apparently, it is on some sort of wireless system and it shuts off if there is no movement in the room. To be fair, someone did come to change the air filter, but it was still mediocre. 2. The concierge gave us instructions to catch a train that did not run on the weekends. We waited for 45 minutes in a sweltering subway station, missed plans with friends we were meeting, and remained off-track the entire day.3. There are no free ice cream bars. I know this seems petty, but if you are advertising it on 50 signs throughout the hotel, someone should run up the street to Duane Reed and get a pack to keep on hand, for integrity's sake.4. I asked for an extra sheet for our room (which was tiny, cramped and not at all like the photograph). I waited an hour and called back a second time requesting it..5. I asked for a fan. They sent up a rickety fan that did not work properly. I ended up buying a travel fan and using that..Overall, the location was the only good thing. I was really disappointed with the hotel. It felt like I was at a Red Roof Inn, not a Kimpton hotel. I will probably be spending my money at a Hilton from now on.Good Luck!", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-17"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Very incovenient check-in policy", "text": "It may be hard to find a cheaper room, but there are definitely some drawbacks on this one. One primary problem is that while check-in is at 3, and while the staff seems to be firm about that, they do not provide a secure place for you to leave your bag. I understand that this is not a luxury hotel, but is it a luxury to have a place to leave your bag? They offer a room on the first floor where you can stash it, but it is unlocked and everyone in the hotel then knows that. We had to walk around SF terrain with our luggage until precisely 3 and, on the day of our departure, were again laden with our bags. I highly doubt that we were the only ones for whom this was a problem and don't see why it couldn't be easily remedied by having the desk attendant walk over and unlock and relock the storage room door.And while I know that others have mentioned the murals, you have to see them to believe them. It is actually not so much the images (I can live with a tulip cart and an entire seascape on the wall's upper border) but the thickness and dinginess of paint. Our room also had an incredibly stained and disgusting ironing board which really did a lot to turn one off.The location of the Adante is great; the lobby looks nice; and there are worse case scenarios (actual bugs or theft or completely rude staff). But just know that if you're going to SF for anything other than marathon sightseeing (i.e. if you want to relax in your room at points during the day or have a romantic getaway) you'll be very depressed having to do so in the Adante.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-10-27"}

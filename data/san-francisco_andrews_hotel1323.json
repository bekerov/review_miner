{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Comfortable with an a good central location", "text": "We stayed at the Andrews Hotel for a couple of nights at the beginning of August. The room was small, but very comfortable and quiet, with everything we needed. The location was excellent - we were able to walk to Union Square and the Ferry Building, Chinatown, and Fisherman's Wharf, which made it a very convenient base. The Hotel is also very close to a number of car rental places, so it was easy to walk to one at the end of our stay to pick up a car.I'd definitely stay here again if I were to return to San Francisco.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-09-26"}

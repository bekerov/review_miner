{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "A great little place in the Big Apple", "text": "My wife and I stayed at the 414 Inn for a weekend in May 2005. We arrived a number of hours prior to check in and were told we could leave our luggage in the lobby while we explored the city for a few hours. Mike was a real pleasure to deal with at the front desk. He gave us maps of the area, explained the subway system, and told us of a number of great places to dine in the area. The location of the hotel is terrific. Plenty of restaurants and shops nearby and only a short walk to the center of Times Square and Broadway theaters. The rooms are nice sized for NYC. They are nothing very special, but they are clean, have comfortable beds, and are very quiet. One negative is the lack of an elevator. We were on the 3rd floor and it was a job to drag our luggage up and down the narrow stairway. The breakfast that is included in the price is a nice extra. Each morning there was a table set up near the lobby with croissants, mini bagels, muffins, cereal, juice, and coffee. For the location, price, and friendliness of the staff the 414 Inn is a great bargain. Don't expect anything luxurious though.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-07"}

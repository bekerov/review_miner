{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great location", "text": "The Allerton Hotel on Magnificent Mile is a great place to stay. It is located on Michigan &amp; Huron close to stores like e.g. Neman Marcus, Macys', Polo Palph Loren, Apple store, Cheese cake factory and Blumindale. On the attractions e.g. Navy Pier, John Hancock Center and Hershey s for the kids. There are many other sites to see just south of the hotel if you don't mind waking. About the hotel, the breakfast was pricey but the service was good. We found places a lot cheaper to eat. We were disappointed with the cleaning staff lack of details e.g. low in shower gel, which we had to ask for new refills, shower did not appear to be cleaned. At night and sometimes during the day, we were constantly approached buy peddlers asking for money and they got nasty if one ignored them.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-25"}

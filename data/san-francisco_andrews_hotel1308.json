{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great hotel for the price", "text": "A great hotel and value for money. Spent 4 nights there during our honeymoon and would definitely return to the Andrews again. The staff were excellent and very helpful. Great location too being only a couple of blocks away from Union Square (as well as a great laundry place nearby who can deliver your items back to the hotel for free!). We were impressed with the Italian restaurant at the Hotel too. Overall an excellent stay.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-04-18"}

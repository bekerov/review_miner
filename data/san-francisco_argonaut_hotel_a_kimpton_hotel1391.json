{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Location", "text": "This is just the best place to stay, the open top sight seeing bus stops a few blocks away, the tram terminus is in the next street and you can walk to where you get the ferry for Alcatraz. Walk out of the hotel and take a right and you're amongst all the shops and restaurants, some great places for breakfast such as Johnny Rockets and a place that makes bread in all kinds of animal shapes. Now about the hotel, rooms are spacious and nicely decorated: loved the nautical theme! There is a lovely warm feeling about the hotel and the reception area is a great place to relax in lovely big comfy sofas and armchairs.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-18"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Good location but thats it DISAPPOINTING", "text": "My wife and i chose this hotel because we have had great experiences in the past with Kimpton Hotels (DC &amp; Vancouver). The location was conveniently located close to Grand Central but other than that, theres not much else in the area. The bad: my wife and i went to breakfast at the Silverleaf Tavern and the hostess was too busy to acknowledge us, so we sat ourselves. When she finally came over to greet us, she asked us if we had the &quot;discount vouchers for breakfast&quot;. I assumed it something to do with being an &quot;IN TOUCH&quot; member with that plus I also received an envelope on arrival. So i inquired if i was suppose to receive that from the front desk during check in, she said &quot;yes&quot; and directed me to the front desk. when i inquired about it @ the front desk, the girl was rude and unattentive. instead of explaining to me that the breakfast voucher option was a prepaid choice during booking, she rudely denied me a voucher with no explanation. we were hungry so it stayed for breakfast anyways. service was terrible and the &quot;buffet&quot; was limited with very few options. the server never came to refresh my coffee or offer us a refill on OJ. To my surprise the bill was $64+ a 18% gratuity was added. RIDICULOUS!!!!!!! The rooms were small and lacked lighting. I've stayed in dozens of hotels in Manhattan and i expect the rooms to be smaller but when you chose Kimpton Hotels, you expect a certain standard. This hotel does not meet the expectations of Kimpton name. Wine reception: was served a dirty glass twice. one had lipstick on it still.Checkout was slow and unorganized and door attendants were unhelpful with our bags.I doubt i'll return.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-25"}

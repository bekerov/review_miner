{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Pet and Kid Friendly - and great for grownups too!", "text": "We just returned from a long weekend in San Francisco, staying at the Argonaut. The location is perfect. It is a couple blocks away from the huge loud crowds around Pier 39, yet just a short block to the cable car turnaround and Irish coffee at the Buena Vista. Although we were petless this weekend, we met many nice dogs during our stay, including several large dogs (like ours). The hotel is across the street from a dog-friendly park with a beach - terrific for dogs as well as kids. The maritime museum, with many boats to board, is also across the street. Ghirardelli Square is also two blocks away ( though sadly there aren't many fun places there anymore).The hotel itself is spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Our room faced an interior courtyard so there were no views - but no noise either, which we appreciated. The room was equipped with a coffeemaker (with complimentary Starbucks coffee!) iron &amp; ironing board, power strip with lots of outlets for laptops and phone chargers (why don't all hotels think of this?) and complimentary wi-fi. Very people-friendly!I've spent a lot more on hotels and received a lot less. The only downside is that parking is VERY expensive - but there is excellent nearby public transportation, so don't bring a car. And the staff is very friendly too. I'm sure we'll be back - I just can't think of a better place to stay in San Francisco...", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-21"}

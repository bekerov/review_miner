{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great location great value...will stay here next time in Chicago", "text": "We got a fantastic rate at this hotel for an overnight stay in Chicago. The reviews seemed kind of mixed to us and it only rates #90 ish on TA, so was kind of concerned. We checked in late, around 11 PM and the agent was unable to upgrade us as our reservation promised so she comped us a free bfast.The concierge, the bellman and the check in agent were all tremendously pleasant and helpful.The mext morning, we had a fantastic bfast. I travel extensively on business and have stayed at all of the best hotels in most major cities in NA....this bfast was as good as any and the staff were very attentive and friendly.AS stated already, the location is excellent.Our room was very clean, smallish that is true.The acid test for me is always how clean the bathroom is and most importantly does the shower have good pressure. We were in a King Jr. suite on the 22nd floor and the water pressure was good.I highly recommend this hotel.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-21"}

This was my first time staying at this hotel, as well as my first trip New York City. I had a fantastic time in the City and loved everything about this hotel. The location is ideal.......only four blocks from Grand Central and walking distance to several sights, shops, and restaurants. Every single employee of the staff were friendly beyond expectations. Sophia (front desk) always greeted me by my name and made me feel welcomed. Christopher (concierge) was also very friendly and helpful. The doormen and housekeeping were very friendly too.....always saying hello with a smile whenever I passed by them. The rooms are small, but standard size for New York. And I found the room to be rather quaint, relaxing, and quiet. This will definitely be my hotel of choice next time I visit New York City.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-11"}

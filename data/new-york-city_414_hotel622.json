{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Good Location Reasonable Price", "text": "We stayed here for 4 nights in August, 2005 and were very happy with our stay. We are Hoosier folk and after reading reviews for other inexpensive (by NYC standards, not Indiana's!) hotels, I was prepared for a depressing shoebox, but I was pleasantly surprised. The room was good sized for 2 people, with a large bathroom. The furnishings were clean, modern, and tasteful. The worst thing was our air conditioner, which was loud and with controls which were hard to adjust. This is really two buildings separated by a courtyard. Our room was in the back half: so we had to walk outside through the courtyard to get to our room, which might be a problem in rain or snow, but we had no problems with noise. It is a small hotel, so the staff has a personal feel and they were friendly and attentive. The continental breakfast was ordinary but sufficient: good croissants, bagels, orange juice, cereal. There is an Internet connected computer in the lobby for guests use to check e-mail or look up reviews, etc. The best feature is the location so close to the theater district. We went to 3 Broadway shows in 4 nights and they were all within easy walking distance. There are so many restaurants nearby that you get tired of the sidewalk hucksters trying to get you to stop at their restaurant. There is a comedy club practically across the street, a dry cleaners a half-block away, etc. The subway is not too close, about 6 blocks. All in all, I would be happy to come back here and look forward to our next visit.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-09-15"}

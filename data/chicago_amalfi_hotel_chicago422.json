{"city": "chicago", "title": "Wonderful Place", "text": "We stayed four nights and were impressed by the quality of service, at a reasonable rate. The staff were extremely courteous. The room was on the smaller side, but with very nice amenities (comfortable bed, soft towels, turn-down service). They had a huge FREE breakfast and coffee-tea service each morning on every floor. The coffee and pastries were delicious. The location was great for the main attractions. We will def. stay at this hotel again!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-21"}

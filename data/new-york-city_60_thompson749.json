{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "great location but.....", "text": "Excellent concierge team.Rooms a little shabier this time round. A non- matching and badly marked chest of drawers seemed at odds with the design focus to which the welcome pack alluded. Maintaining the design focus is a challenge which needs continuing investment and it is not clear whether this is recognised.Returning to the room at 2pm and after 4pm to find the room unmade was disappointing. Reception seemed surprised I found this substandard. The only staff visit to the room was to check the minibar which seemed a misplaced service priority. Having a room prepared before dark does not seem an excessive requirement particularly when vacant since early morning.The fact that I have not received a reply to my note to the manager makes me question whether feedback is valued or whether it is perceived to be important to say that it is.At just under 500USD per night it could have been better. The reviewer who paid 200USD got the bargain.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-01-03"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Absolute Gem", "text": "Myself and my two girlfriends stayed here, from the 29th November till the 3rd December. I have to say the staff were polite and helpful. We were luckily put on the first floor just over reception, we had a twin room with a roll out bed. The room was clean and bright and the bathroom was spotless. To be honest we were on a shopping trip so the room was really messy each morning we left. But every evening on our return, the room was spotless, with fresh linen on the beds every single day. Each morning you could get fresh croissants, muffins, bagels, cereal, juices and tea or coffee, which I have to say was a lovely bonusI can't speak well enough of this hotel. It is a brilliant bargain in NYC and only a few steps away from Times Square, bus station and Rockefellar. We will without doubt be going back to this hotel!!!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-01-03"}

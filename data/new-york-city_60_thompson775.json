{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "excellent", "text": "just got back from nyc after having stayed at 60 thompson for 5 nights. i must say that the hotel, the staff, the restaurant, the location, the concierge, the room - all was top notch. if you can stretch to a superior room (pay about $350) then do it, as the smaller rooms are definately too small for anything more than an overnight stay. thompson street is well placed for great vibes, bars, restaurants &amp; cool shops. i thought that $ 18 for two cups of coffee was a bit off a liberty, so go eleswhere for that kind of stuff. overall, however, i found 60 thompson to be spot on.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-01-17"}

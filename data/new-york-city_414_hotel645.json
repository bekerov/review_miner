{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "414 Inn - not bad!", "text": "We stayed here for six nights in December 2004. The clientele book mostly via the web, usually using hotels. There are a fair number of international visitors, as well as folks who would have been in youth hostels a few years ago. The location is great - just west of Ninth. The buffet breakfast is OK - but be warned, the eats go fast! The stairway is steep (OSHA compliant?) and there is no elevator - be warned again. The rooms are SMALL, but clean. Somehow, the same level of cleanliness does not apply to the stairway carpets or the &quot;lobby&quot; (I use the term loosely). The staff said they planned to renovate the lobby after Christmas (it needs it badly!). The radiator in the bedroom had no controls, so we had to open the window to cool things down (in December!). One bar of soap to schlep between the sink and the shower. Bottom line, a reasonable value (NYC hotel prices have gone through the roof lately). Would we stay there again? No, thanks.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-12-12"}

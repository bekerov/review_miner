{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great find in NYC!", "text": "What a gem for NYC. The location is awesome, close to Broadway and Times Square, but off on a very quiet street. The room was large and bathroom was very spacious, especially for New York. The air-conditioning worked fine and the desk people were very pleasant.There are no elevators, so be prepared to carry your luggage upstairs...I was on the 3rd floor, there were 2 more levels above me. They are a little short on some amenities, like no place to safely store luggage before or after checking in or out, but have some others that are nice, like free wireless internet, free continental breakfast and kitchen privileges. Overall, they offer a nice quiet stay in a very busy city for a very reasonable price.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-28"}

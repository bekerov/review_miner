{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Friendly Staff Clean and Cheap...", "text": "I spent 3 nights here and it was a nice comfortable stay indeed. The first night was mediocre due to an issue with the bathroom, but once the manger was told he took care of it right away, and was very gracious and apologetic...one can't ask for more than that right? In fact the manager was extremely friendly and helpful to every guest with public transportation and sight-seeing tip, also he was great about helping me find late night parking when the hotel's on site lot was full...he awoke from his sleep when he heard me pull in late that night....now how nice was that? I would certainly stay here again above all other hotels in this price range, and have already referred a few others. Good luck and enjoy!", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-30"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Go glam in NY", "text": "I have just returned from NY where I stayed at 60 Thompson for 3 nights. What a fab place and I really did feel at home. The hotel is in a perfect location - lots of cool shops and restos. The rooms are cosy and I felt at home - loved the cheeky brownie on your pillow at night - nice touch!. Most of the staff were friendly. Access to the roof top bar is a bonus - we swigged champagne and admired the views as well as the cute bar mangager. All in all a good stay - I will be back soon.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-09-29"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Excellent Theater Hotel", "text": "Having travelled enough times to have worn out many suitcases my wife and I make our hotel choices on a number of different factors: central location permitting travel by foot as well as by public transportation; reasonable cost; clean with private toilet facilities; a bit of character. That being said, the 414 qualifies these tests. Manhattan, being the size it is, has many different areas; the 414 is central to Times Square and the theater district. It is at the end of &quot;Restaurant Row&quot; on 46th Street close to 9th. You can walk to almost every theater in minutes and after the performance walk back to the 414. Our cost for a double with minimal continelntal breakfast of coffee, juice, cereal, rolls was $189.00 a night for a double. The rooms are not large nor are they tiny and the 40 inch LCD tv on the wall is a nice touch. The bed is comfortable and the lines crisp and clean. The bathroom is good size. A brownstone type of facade is appealing and 22 rooms is much more acceptable than the 200-400 concrete and metal structures in and around Times Square. The negatives: no elevator and that means you carry your luggage to the 2nd, 3rd or 4th floor; also, this time we noticed a small amount of mold on a shower wall--small is still too much. We will always try to stay here on our theater visits. The money saved will pay for the theater tickets.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-27"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Not a 'Guest Friendly' Hotel", "text": "We booked our reservation online thru Priceline, stating that there would be 3 guests. Upon arrival we were given a room with one queen bed. When we requested a room with 2 beds the clerk said we'd have to pay an additional $29 per night for the extra bed. The hotel was not full, but the clerk wasn't interested in making a customer happy. My son ended up sleeping on the floor for 3 nights. Also, the parking at the Allerton is $36 per night, which seems outrageous. The staff acted indifferent and rarely did we see a smile or greeting from any of them, except for the concierge, who always smiled and greeted guests warmly. I think I will stay somewhere else on my next visit to Chicago.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-09-29"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Excellent hotel bang in Fisherman's Wharf", "text": "Stayed here on a trip to California, were in San Francisco for 4 nights.ServiceVery friendly and polite check in staff, always helpful and smiley. The hotel restaurant also had a good and welcoming service. The rooms were spotless and cleaned to a high standard.RoomThe room was a good size, had a room with 2 double beds and was well equipped with free wi-fi, tv and iPod radio dock. The bathroom was clean and modern also. As the hotel was originally a warehouse, the window was small and had a limited view when we expected to have great views over at Alcatraz and the bay.LocationOne of the few decent hotels in Fisherman's Wharf. A fantastic location for exploring the wharf, biking the bridge and Alcatraz. However it's very touristy and the food isn't great in the area. Best bit is to jump on the cable car a minutes walk from the hotel and go into downtown San Francisco. It gets busy at night, but a taxi isn't too expensive either. AmenitiesDidn't really use much of the hotel's features as were out and about most of the time, it did have a Nintendo Wii free of use in the hotel lobby though which was a nice touch.OverallA comfortable, high standard hotel defiantly worth considering if planning to visit San Francisco.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-15"}

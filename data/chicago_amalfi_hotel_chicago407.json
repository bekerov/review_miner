{"city": "chicago", "title": "The Most Impressive and Unique Hotel Experience", "text": "We spent the American Thanksgiving Weekend in Chicago and part of our great weekend was thanks to the Amalfi. It is unique from the get-go, in a very good way. The decor is funky/retro, the staff very friendly and helpful and the rooms amazing. I can't really say anything bad about this place. The price is very fair for what this hotel offers.The rooms were impeccable, can you believe the Aveda bath products? Extra touches like magazine/book/DVD selection, turndown service (mmm...we looked forward to our Ghiradelli chocolate treats left behind), and the cozy bathrobes and slippers, were features that made this hotel so amazing.Their breakfast served on the foyers of most floors was very cleanly presented with a variety of options. You could grab your own little basket in your robe and head back to your room to enjoy a nice breakfast. We couldn't believe the cocktail/hors d'oeuvres hour, we've never seen anything like it! We thought it could be cheesy, but it wasn't at all. The buffet selection was impressive and they were serving a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.The location of this hotel is pretty prime. My husband and I took the Blue Line train (CTA) directly from O'Hare to the Clark/Lake station and walked the easy 5 mins to the Amalfi. The $4 for the two of us certainly beat the $50 we would have paid via taxi or shuttle. And trust me, we don't have problems spending the money. But it's so straightforward and convenient, then why not? The $46 could be put towards a nice purchase on theThe Magnificent Mile (which by the way is only 2 blocks down from this hotel)! You could always take a quick cab ride from the Clark/Lake station as well if you dont want to walk.If life ever takes us back to Chicago, I refuse to stay anywhere else...they should have more Amalfi's around the world!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-11-26"}

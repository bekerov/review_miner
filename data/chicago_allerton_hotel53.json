{"city": "chicago", "title": "Good location but not worth the price", "text": "Was booked here for a meeting - the organizers thought we would like the historic aspect of the hotel. The lobby and public areas are indeed stylish, as are the rooms. But rooms are REALLY tiny. Only one wastebasket, so I had to keep moving it between the desk and bathroom. Lots of hall noise, the A/C was also very noisy and the bathroom fan was deafening. Neither my room phone nor remote control was working during my stay, and the staff were cool and not very friendly. Parking and food are very expensive. The hotel is in a great location for downtown attractions, but the overall experience was not impressive.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-19"}

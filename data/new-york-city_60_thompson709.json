{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "great location - terrific restaurant", "text": "I would go back,. We just returned from a four night stay. We had two rooms; a deluxe King and a deluxe double. It is a little overpriced when you consider the size of the rooms but you are paying for the location which is unbeatable. We liked the staff, particularly Michael, and thought the concierge staff was terrific.They were friendly and very helpful. The restaurant, Kittichai, is excellent. For breakfast I would recommend Balthazar at the corner of Crosby and Spring.It is an excellent break from the stuffier uptown hotels.Just make sure you bring your laptop. The only internet access the hotel has is at the front desk and it is slowwww.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-09-14"}

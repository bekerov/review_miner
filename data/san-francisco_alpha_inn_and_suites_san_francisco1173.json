The room was clean and tidy and adequate for what I wanted. It is very near the 30 bus route to Fisherman's wharf and Downtown. In reach of the bay for walks along the Marina. Opoosite a 24 hr Walgreen's Drug Store for late night snacks!As an alternative there are plenty of other motel literally within 5 mins walk of this hotel. I should have tried them as an alternative.The traffic is quite noisy as Lombard St is en route to the Golden Gate Bridge", "hotel": "alpha_inn_and_suites_san_francisco", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-03-08"}

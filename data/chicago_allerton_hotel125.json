{"city": "chicago", "title": "Hated the Allerton", "text": "My friend and I were meeting up in Chicago and asked for rooms close to each other (we booked this 5 months in advance). She got a room on one floor and I on another. My lovely room overlooked what appeared to be a prison yard. Why are there Ice machines and no ice buckets?My room card key only would work once and then I would have to call security to be let in. I was there for four days and this happened daily. We were given incorrect directions to the boat tour and the Concierge had a very aloof attitude. Small coffee service in lobby with a table so small that everyone spilled. But they had a grand piano to take up space.Place looks great on the internet but they took a beautiful old gem and tried to make it modern with paint (dark gray with a green tinge) for the dining room. Entry to hotel smelled like a sewer and when they would put the elevator out of service they couldn't even bother to put up a sign!Food sucked, I ordered granola and they put the milk on it for me!Needless to say, soggy city and waiter was annoyed we didn't opt for the buffet so his tip would go up.Oh, and the last night I was there I sat in the chair and tried to put up the window for some air and the top popped out and hit me on the head. Thanks, I needed that!I sent the hotel a response to their satisfaction survey and got back the standard blah blah blah e-mail. They could care less!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-19"}

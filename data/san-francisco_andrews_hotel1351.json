I must agree with all the &quot;positive&quot; comments in this forum regarding breakfast, staff, fino restaurant, etc. The only negative point would be the window of room 609 (where we stayed for a couple of nights) it was slightly broken...very thin windows, outdoor noises get through easily. I had to put the extra pillows (on the window) as a camouflage to cut the noise! I reserved directly via email, cheapest way.

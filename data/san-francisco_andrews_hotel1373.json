{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "An excellent budget hotel of rare character.", "text": "I just came back from San Francisco and feel compelled to write a review of this wonderful hotel. Taking price into the equation, this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Just a few points here: 1) The location is fantastic. 2) The rooms are both characterful - something very rare in hotels in this price range these days - and well provisioned. 3) The staff know the city backwards, are very professional, and even at busy times, were always ready to help. 4) Breakfast is included - again something that is rare in American hotels in this price range - and a basket of fruit is available on each floor throughout the day. What a great place! ", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-05-08"}

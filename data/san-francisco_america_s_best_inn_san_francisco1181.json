{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great Location Tired Property", "text": "This property was in a great location and it had free parking. It was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. We left our car (it was safe) there during our four day stay and walked to all the great sites. The bus was close to take us to the Golden Gate Bridge. There were several great restaurants just three blocks away from the Warf. The towels were thin and rough, being on a busy street made for a noisy stay. Upon our return, we will stay here again and would recommend this motel to you if you are looking for a good location to the Fishermans Warf. We will bring our own towels next time.We selected this property for its location, great price, free parking.", "hotel": "america_s_best_inn_san_francisco", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-22"}

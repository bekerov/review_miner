{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Place!!!", "text": "We found a great deal but when we read the reviews we were a little apprehensive about staying here. I'm so glad we decided to stick with it because everything exceeded our expectations.The location is beyond perfect!! The staff is very helpful.We read about the small rooms so we decided to get a king suite on the top floor and it was amazing!!! (photos included). We requested a fridge and they brought one up as soon as one was available. I just loved it here!!! I can't wait to go back and try to get the same room.Note: I tried to add more than 3 photos and it won't let me...if you want to see more of the room let me know!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-06"}

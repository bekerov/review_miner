{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "lovely clean hotel nice staff", "text": "We chose the Adante hotel on the basis of it's excellent reviews on trip advisor, and we were not disappointed, the room was immaculately clean, as was the bathroom and all the communal areas. As we were travelling with 2 small children cleanliness was important to us. Staff at the Adante were always helpful and polite and on one morning when my husband was about to take our 1 year old daughter out at 5am to get her something to eat, the hotel concierge got her a muffin early from the breakfast tray. The location of the hotel is excellent, we were worried it was a bit close to the tenderlon but it is more in the theatre district and close to some really smart hotels, and great for a shopaholic like to me to get to all the great shops!All in all I would heartily recommend the adante hotel, it has a great breakfast and really comfy foyer to have your breakfast and plan your day.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-03-30"}

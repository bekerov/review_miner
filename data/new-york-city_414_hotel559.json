{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Can't wait to return!", "text": "My husband and I called this place home for four wonderful nights. We arrived early and the hotel kindly monitored our luggage. We were told that our bags would be in our room when we returned at check in time. However, this was not the case but was not a huge issue or inconvenience. We were told we were going to be placed on the top floor in their second building because it would be quieter. We certainly found this to be the case. There is no elevator in this hotel so be prepared to work your calf muscles. We found the staff to be helpful and polite. The daytime clerk offered to call a car to drive us back to Newark Airport and watched our luggage until it was time to leave. This hotel was great! We are so happy we stayed here. We prefer quaint originality to a huge monstrosity of a hotel chain any day! The location was superb! You walk through Restaurant Row to get to anywhere you want to go. The distance to Times Square is very brief. We will definitely stay here again! Thanks for a great time!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-12-15"}

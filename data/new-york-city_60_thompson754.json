{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "One night's stay", "text": "Stayed one cold night in December. Room was nice and well decorated with a fancy shower but no tub. Lobby and bar were really nice, the room came close but was relatively small and unfortunately was supposed to be non-smoking but from the burns on the floor and the smell on the phone was obviously for smoking. A bit noisy too, caused by an adjacent occupant. Overall, pretty good.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-12-16"}

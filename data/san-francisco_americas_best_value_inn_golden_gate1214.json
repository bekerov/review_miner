{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Perfect place on a budget", "text": "This place was perfect for us- It was a girls vacation: My daughter, granddaughter and me. The Inn's front desk was helpful and nice. Our room was clean and perfect for our stay-we only needed a place to store our luggage, a clean bathroom-shower and bed to sleep in at night. Our room was close to the road but we heard nothing once we closed the door. The location is perfect for catching the bus to go to all the sights and places SF has to offer- the only way to travel in SF. It was close to all the shops, pubs, markets and resturants. I would recommend it to anyone and stay there again.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-31"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great value for money", "text": "Booking a 1* hotel sight unseen can be a bit risky but we were delighted with our choice. We caught the BART from the airport to Powell St and wheeled our luggage to the Adante. Our plane arrived early in the morning but they have a luggage room for storing baggage when necessary. The room was small but clean, quiet and comfortable, which is all we ask in a hotel. The bus at the door goes to Golden Gate Park and y ou can walk to the cable cars and Union Square. Breakfast of muffins, toast, juice and coffee is enough to get you going for the day and the internet cafe right next door is very convenient. Would have no hesitation in staying here again.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-10"}

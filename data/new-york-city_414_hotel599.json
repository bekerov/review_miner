{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Very pleasant stay", "text": "My husband and I stayed at the 414 for 5 days in January and we were very pleased. I did my homework in checking out reviews for New York City hotels in this vicinity and all the positive reviews I read on the 414 were correct. It was a quaint little inn - the room was a good size, with very decent size bathroom - all very clean. And the bed was about the most comfortable I've ever slept in. Coffee, juice, rolls, bagels etc. out in the lobby in the morning were very nice. And the front desk was always very helpful and accommodating. And you really can't beat the location - so convenient (walking distance) to so much, especially the theatre district and Times Square. And being on Restaurant Row was great, espcially for late night dinners and entertainment. The 414 and New York City was fabulous. We can't wait to go back.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-02-18"}

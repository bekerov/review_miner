{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "The Most Amazing Hotel!", "text": "I got the most amazing deal on Quikbook! The Bell staff, reception and concierge are all extremely helpful, not to mention very good looking. This is a trendy hotel!I also have to state that this place is SPOTLESS!!! I have never stayed in a hotel more clean than this, and it smells great too. When they turn your bed down at night you even get a mini brownie to eat with your night cap!I stayed in a Pod Room. Don't be fooled by the name, the room is a brilliant size. You get a double bed, more than enough floor space and a full size bathroom. The only downside is that there's hardly any natural daylight even though you have a full size window, it faces the shaft.The location is perfect, just across the road from the Time Warner Building and Columbus Circle subway and next door to a Duane Read, also a stone's throw from Central Park.If I can get another deal (usually the hotel is quite expensive) this will absolutely be my hotel of choice every time I go to New York. I pity the poor suckers paying way over the odds for a tiny room at the Hudson on the same road, 6 Columbus is miles better!!", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-11"}

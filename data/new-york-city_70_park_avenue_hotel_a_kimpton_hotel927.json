{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Incredible stay at 70 Park Ave!", "text": "Wonderful Boutique hotel in NYC!This review is LONG overdue. We stayed here for a whirlwind weekend visit in February 2008, in celebration of my boyfriend's birthday. (And to see Eddie Izzard at the Union Sq Theater!). It was my boyfriend's first trip to NYC, and it was very memorable.We had a beautiful corner room on the 17th floor, with views of both the Empire State Building and Park Ave. The concierge, Jennifer, was amazing. She helped to make our stay completely unforgettable. She really went the extra mile to make our trip special. I can't thank her enough!We had an issue with the plumbing in the bathroom upon our arrival, and maintenance arrived within 15 mins from when we alerted the front desk to the problem. Prompt service!The bed was comfortable... and the slippers, and robes were a lovely touch. All in all, we were very pleased with our stay. We would love to stay there again during an upcoming trip to NYC, but have been unable to find any rooms in our price range for January 2010. I don't know if things have changed there since our visit in Feb. 2008, but unfortunately the prices certainly have.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-20"}

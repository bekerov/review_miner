{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Fabulous Stay - Enjoyed Every Minute!", "text": "My partner and I stayed at the Argonaut for 4 nights (17th-21st August 2009), on the first leg of a West Coast of the USA tour. We selected this hotel for its purported, excellent location on Fisherman's Wharf. We had booked a deluxe, view room on a room only basis. On arrival at the hotel, we were impressed by the warm welcome and efficient check-in and even more impressed by our room size and its amenities. We found that we had a view of the Golden Gate, but i have to say that much of the time this view was obscured by the San Francisco fog. The nautical decor of our room was very striking, but I, personally, loved it and felt it to be in perfect keeping with the hotel's geographical location. We were delighted to find that the hotel was providing us with complimentary continental breakfast and that there was a free wine reception between 5 and 6 pm every day - this proved to be a very congenial event that we appreciated very much after each day of sightseeing in this fabulous city. They also provided free, unlimited internet access.Throughout our stay, we found the staff to be very helpful and friendly and we enjoyed breakfast and several evening meals in the hotel's restaurant. The menu consisted of mainly fish and seafood (as could be expected) and we found the food to be of good quality and reasonably priced. The hotel's location is perfect for visiting San Francisco as it is adjacent to the cable car turnaround on Fisherman's Wharf and also very convenient for hopping onto the great 'streetcars'. Pier 39 is a short and pleasant stroll away.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to explore this beautiful city and I can't wait to book another stay there so that I can explore the area at my leisure.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-05"}

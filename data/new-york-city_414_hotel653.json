{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "A Gem in NYC", "text": "August 2004 - We just got back from our 4 night stay at 414 Inn, a lovely small hotel in the theatre district. We arrived in the city at 2 am and walked up 8th av thinking twice about the location. Then we turned right on 46th and landed in a charming neighborhood. A couple of blocks along &quot;restaurant row&quot; and we were there. Our room was clean and quiet, decorated in a pleasant modern style with crisp white linens and down comforter. Bathrooms are spacious. A nice continental breakfast is served in the lobby each morning (you can take breakfast out to the courtyard in the back to eat alfresco).The staff could not have been nicer or more helpful.All this for a reasonable price. My husband and I highly recommend this gem of a hotel.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-08-20"}

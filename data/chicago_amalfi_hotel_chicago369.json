{"city": "chicago", "title": "Pretty nice stay", "text": "I just recently stayed at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago for a short personal/business trip. My boyfriend and I stayed there the weekend before I had a conference for work and then I stayed 3 days there by myself. My boyfriend and I both agreed one really good thing about this hotel is that it is in a really good location. Most everything is within walking distance with the exception of the main tourist attractions (museums, navy pier, aquarium, etc). To see those we had to take about an $8 taxi ride.The hotel staff was nice...not over the top accomadating, but nice. The entire hotel has a modern feel to it. The rooms are really nice, clean and simply decorated. The bathroom is a good size with lots of counter space (which is important to a woman...at least me). I have to say, I travel quite a bit for business and normally have a hard time sleeping, but the beds there are very comfortable. One thing that bothered me about the hotel was their room service...they technically don't have any. There is a restaurant next door called &quot;Harry Carry's&quot; which they order room service from. You place your order with room service in the hotel, they place the order with Harry Carry's, and bring it back to you. I ordered room service both nights I was here alone and the food was marginal if that. My food arrived luke warm (if that), it arrived late (they quoted me 30 min...took almost an hour), and the dinner rolls were hard as rocks (both nights). On top of all that it was very expensive...over $30 for a plate of spaghetti, a salad and glass of water. If room service isn't important to you...I reccomend staying here. Overall pleasurable experience. Tip- Visit &quot;Rockit bar and grille&quot; right down the street. They have really good food, cool/young atmosphere, and a cool after dinner lounge upstairs.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-30"}

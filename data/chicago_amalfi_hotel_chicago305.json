{"city": "chicago", "title": "Glad Other Places Were Booked - The Amalfi Was A Great Find", "text": "We stayed at the Amalfi Hotel on the weekend of June 13th. With lots of events in Chicago that weekend, many of the places we tried to book first were full. We found a decent rate at the Amalfi, which included parking, complimentary cocktails, and a light breakfast (total cost was $299 including tax). We really liked the room. It was clean and beautifully decorated with some nice extra touches (such as good magazines), the bed and pillows were very comfortable, and the bathroom had Aveda products and a fantastic double shower-head. The in-room heating and cooling system was quiet and worked well. The lobby was upscale, and the check-in and check-out were streamlined and very fast. All staff were friendly and courteous.We did take advantage of the complimentary cocktail hour in the lounge - we got there about 15 minutes prior to the end, and there was a long line for the bar, but it moved fairly quickly and we were able to get our drinks and relax in a quiet corner. They serve some light appetizers along with top-shelf liquor. Breakfast was basic (coffee, juices, fruit, yogurt, bagels and muffins) but adequate. It is served on each floor, which is really convenient. We also liked the location of the hotel - it is very central and close to lots of downtown destinations. Obviously, on a summer weekend, many of our fellow guests were there to enjoy the downtown area, so there was a little noise from party-goers and some street noise, but nothing significant.Overall, the price was not a bargain, but we felt we definitely got what we paid for and we would make this one of our first choices for a return trip.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-15"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Horrible and stinking. DO NOT STAY THERE !!!", "text": "I booked this hotel through the Econo Lodge website after reading the reviews poted here. This hotel was TERRIBLE !!! There is no lobby, the parking is VERY limited and it is rather difficult to find a place on the street.I reserved a suite for about $110 (US dollars) and got an absolute dump (see the photos I have taken).Upon entering the building a strong disinfectant odor attacked us. This smell was also in the so called &quot;suite&quot;. There was no elavator and our room was located on the 4th floor ! I had to carry 3 large suitcases up the stairs ! The corridors and stairs were filthy, and one of the stairs made sounds and wiggled like it was going to fall off.The room was filthy. The rugs were torn and stained. The disinfectant smell was everywhere. The sofa-bed in the living room part of the &quot;suite&quot; was broken and you couldn't sit on it or open it into a bed (see the photos).We immediately went down to the reception desk and asked for another room. The clerk was rude and refused. He said he had no other rooms available due to a convention of some sort... I cannot imagine a convention accommodating its participants in this dump...Please take my advice and do not stay there, no matter the price. I paid a lot of money and got nothing in return.DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL !!!", "hotel": "alpha_inn_and_suites_san_francisco", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-05"}

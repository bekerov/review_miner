{"city": "chicago", "title": "Good value", "text": "For the most part, very pleased with our weekend stay at the Allerton. Very stylish boutique hotel right in the middle of Magnificent Mile. Room was small, but no smaller than expected for a city room (I've seen smaller in New York!). Staff was very friendly and helpful when we had questions about getting around. On the day of our departure, we had some time after checkout before our flight home; we left our bags at the desk and I started to leave my coat as well, when the attendant suggested it was a little chilly and I might want to keep it. It's a small thing but shows that they're really paying attention.The downsides: I called room service (which closed at 11 PM) one night at 10:20 to order dessert. The woman who answered the phone told me that the menu in my room was out of date and rattled off the night's selections. I picked one and she told me it would be there in 20 minutes. After 45 minutes, there was no one there and no one picking up at room service; the call went to the front desk and I canceled the order. Annoying but minor.My husband left a pair of pants in the room, which we realized the day after we checked out. We called and they said that no one had turned them in. The head of housekeeping went and checked the room and spoke to the person who had cleaned it, but there was no sign of them. Odd.Overall, though, I would definitely recommend it.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-10-01"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "perfect location cosy hotel", "text": "We spent 5 nights at 70 park Avenue, and were delighted with this choice of hotel. The room was a good size, the bed comfortable and our jacuzzi bath, the little bit of luxury we hoped for!Reception staff at the hotel and helpful and friendly, as are the guys who help with bags etc. However we didn't spend much time actually in the receeption area and didn't shre in a wine tasty session, though did see these events taking place.We were there to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday and having informed the hotel that this was our plan, we were treated to a bottle of bubbly and yummy cake on arrival to our room - a really lovely surprise!70 Park Avenue is 5 minutes walk from grand central station, the empire state building is just around the corner and the chrysler building is leterally at the end of the street. To get a real sense of what its like to be in Midtown Manhattan, we couldn't have chosen a better place to stay.We would recommend you do your city sight seeing from 'Top of the Rock' - the views are exceptional and rather than being inside the empire state building, you get to take photos of it from here!Take the red city bus tours = Greyline - the tour guides are great and you can hop on and hop off these services.Have a good time in New York!", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-16"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Rip off rate for international phone calls! Don't stay here!", "text": "We stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks and we are from Hong Kong. So making a few international phone calls back home was necessary. After staying at the hotel for a few days and making just a few phone calls (literally less than 5 or 6 calls got thru the line and none of our calls were more than 10 minutes each), I asked the concierge how much our phone bill was. Guess what? 6 Columbus charged me more than US$500+ for just a few phone calls!!! They explained that international phone calls cost US$10 per minute. This rate was absolutely ridiculous and the manager blamed us by saying that why didn't we check out the rate in the little book stored in our desk b4 we make the calls. After speaking the manager, we checked out the booklet and it actually didn't set out the rate at all but just mentioned that guests should ask the concierge for the exact rate for making international phone calls. It just didn't make sense to us at all. How could you justify charging the guest US$10 per minute? My 5 minute phone call to a friend asking a few questions cost me US$50+!!!! Completely ridiculous. WE WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANY INTERNATIONAL GUEST TO STAY AT 6 COLUMBUS. It's a complete rip off, given that the economy is so poor in the US. Such ridiculous charging rate is totally unacceptable. And the worse thing was, they refuse to do anything about it at all!!!!!!!!! Our original impression of the hotel was actually pretty good, given the location and the hotel rate and all that. But with the rip off phone rates, i guess that's how the hotels make profit!!! We are going to tell all our friends NOT to stay here if anyone goes to NYC. Completely disappointed!!!!!!", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-02-02"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Very friendly staff!!", "text": "Before we decided on booking a room at the Andrews I contacted the hotel a couple of times since I made bad experiences with other hotels. This place is soooo helpful and very friendly, they reponded right away and gave me all the info I needed.The room we had was rather small but clean! It had been cleaned every day! The parking lot was right behind the hotel and very friendly staff there too!Breakfast was inclusive and served in the hallway so you could take it inside and eat in bed. It was very yummy and there has always been enough food except for the last few minutes of serving. The rates were great and the location too!A 5 minute walk to Union Square! Really a great choice!", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-01-03"}

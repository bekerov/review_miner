{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "70 Park Ave a nice hotel", "text": "After extensive research booked 70 Park Ave through Expedia for a price that was OK by New York standards. Stayed with my family over xmas for six nights and in general had a pleasant experience.PositivesLocation near Grand central and 42nd street, 5th Ave, was great and meant we could walk most places like the Rockafeller centre, Empire state etc.Restaurants nearby are of good quality and can recommend the place in Pershing Square outside Grand central.Hotel is clean, comfy and has really helpful staff, especially liked the wine hour and the ease of getting cabs.Good quality bathroom toiletries, great shower pressure.DislikesThe room heating had to be fixed 4 times during the stay as it seemed to only like pumping out cold air. Gave up in the end as the weather warmed up.Tiny bathroom.We were on the 11th floor at the front and the traffic noise was pretty loud for sleeping.The mini bar and room service prices are a joke, even by British standards - don't bother. Hotel bar similar.The lack of a room tea/coffee machine or even a kettle was a pain and meant trips to Starbucks a hundred yards away for a decent coffee.Overall though a pretty nice experience, mainly because the hotel was clean and the staff really helpful. but would probably go for a bigger hotel nearby if staying in NY again.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-12-31"}

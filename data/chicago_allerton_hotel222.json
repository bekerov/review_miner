{"city": "chicago", "title": "Small but nice", "text": "I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Chicago-Allerton on Friday night. It was a great location to all the clubs and bars. We walked about nine blocks to get to Sound-bar, Y, RiNo, Spyclub, etc.FINDING YOUR WAY AROUND:My friend and I took the subway from O'Hare to the Chicago (Red line) stop and walked about 3 blocks to Michigan Ave. Once on Michigan we began out search for the Crowne Plaza to learn that it is NOT on Michigan Ave technically--the enterance is on Huron. The Nine West shoe store shares the same building and its front is on the Mag Mile. When we entered the Hotel, we learned that check-in is on the THIRD floor using the elevator on the right. If you wanted to go to your room, you had to get on another set of elevators on the third floor. To go to Taps or the lounge, you got on the elevator on the first floor to your left. THE ROOM:Very small. We checked in at 5PM and that's the only avalable room they had. My friend saw it and had a fit, but I didn't care because we didn't spend so much time in it. It had a standard bed (full), a small desk, and a TV on a TV stand. The linens and towels were white and clean. The bathroom was quite nice with marble-ish floors and a see through glass shower. On, the floors are very slippery! The room was very clean and stocked with the following:-Shampoo, conditioner, soap, lotion, and shoe polish-Hair dryer and make-up mirror-On the bed was a linen spray and earplugs-Iron, extra blanket and pillow in the closetSTAFF:Helpful, if not a bit sarcastic. They at least knew how to get around the city. You can also leave your luggage there after check-out to walk around the city.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-03-13"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Awesome Stay at the Amalfi", "text": "We booked the Amalfi at the last minute, almost by accident. I found it on Travel Ticker for $129, which included valet parking. A great deal, coupled with the stellar reviews on TripAdvisor, inspired us to give it a try. We were very pleased with this hotel.Pros: Awesome location in the heart of the city. Comfortable room and bed. Free internet. Free reception nightly with heavy appetizers and top-shelf alcohol. Friendly, accommodating staff. Beautiful, simple decor.Cons: The only con we had was no view from the room.We loved the Amalfi. They don't nickel and dime you like many city hotels. Instead, they actually have complimentary services which make the guest feel valued. We would return here in a heartbeat.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-02"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "A nice lil hotel", "text": "I stayed at the adante on october 29th, I got a great rate for 70$, I had no problems checking into my room at 2pm, the staff had my name on the computer instantly and was quite friendly, the room was on the small side, but i actually liked the paintings on the walls, (fish), the bathroom was quite large considering that the room wasn't that large, I loved the fact that the TV had HBO, and that the room was nice and clean, it also had an in room safe and a iron and ironing board. I didn't need to use any of these but it's nice to have just in case, the bed was very comfortable and there was even an extra pillow in the drawers, the close proximity to union square was great, as Ruby Skye nightclub is just minutes away, this room was a great deal and I'm reasonably happy with it, the only negatives are that at 8am there were some homeless people in the alley outside the room (don't expect a view, unless you like looking at walls), who were making an obsene amount of noise, the pressure of the shower isn't all that great, but not bad, and the width of the hallway make it really hard to get around the maids since we checked out right at 12pm, overall I would definitely recommend the Adante hotel to anyone looking for a great price and a great location.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-10-31"}

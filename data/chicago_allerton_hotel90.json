{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great location well appointed but small rooms", "text": "I only stayed here one night but after my terrible stay at the Hilton (see other review) I was delighted! The location is far better than the Hilton - you step out onto lots of high-end shops and malls. The lobby is hip (with accompanying hip music) and the staff courteous and friendly. The room was small but contemporary, clean, and with up-to-date furnishings and a flat screen TV PLUS it was over $100 less than the Hyatt, I was absolutely delighted!! I would highly recommend this to anyone despite the slow elevators!!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-30"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Value in Mid-Town", "text": "My husband took me to NY City for Mothers Day and we had a fabulous time. We stayed at the Kimpton at 70 Park Avenue. Kimpton Hotels are rapidly becoming my favorite choice for a city hotel. We joined In Touch, their loyalty program which have us free WiFI, a $15 raid the minibar voucher, and wonderful concierge service. We took the train from Wadhington and they also offer a significant Ride the Rails discount - 20% off their best rate if you arrive in the city by Train, We paid $149 for a very nice room on the 16th floor. You cannot beat that in the heart of Manhattan. There is free coffee in the morning and a wine reception in the evening, plush bathrobes, and Occitaine amenities It is pet-friendly but Yes the bathroom is incredibly small. But in exchange we got lots of usable space in the bedroom including a good size desk, an entry way, TWO chairs, lots of electrical outlets, a flat screen TV, a great stereo system, and room to walk around. I recommend this hotel highly.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-11"}

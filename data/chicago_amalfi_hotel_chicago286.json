Our hotel was right across the road from Harry Caray's. The hotel lobby was gorgeous and very modern. The room was beautiful and up to date as well. It included a cd player and a cd collection of jazz music which was a nice touch. The bathrooms were very nice. The bed was incredibly comfortable. We would definitely stay here again.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-15"}

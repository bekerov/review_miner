{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "A delightful stay", "text": "The Andrews Hotel was a delightful find. Our room (two twin beds) was charming, small, but more than adequate with a small sitting area and interesting view looking north toward Nob Hill. The bathroom was clean and convenient, not renovated but fully serviceable and quaint. Breakfast was sumptious, with real dairy for the coffee, fresh fruit and pastries and real butter. The staff, especially Oscar, were helpful, friendly and very knowledgeable about transportation and locations. We had a car (+$25 for parking in a 24-hour attended lot), and Oscar and staff were able to give us easy, accurate driving instructions. The charm of the hotel, the grace of the staff, and the superb location near theatres, cable car, and Muni bus across the street make this MY hotel in San Francisco. I can't wait for my next stay.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-04-06"}

No screens on the windows so you can not open them without bugs flying in. Tiles on bathroom floor popping out. Bedspreads, blankets, curtains and sheets all had holes or burn marks. Promised internet in the rooms but we could not get any service.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-18"}

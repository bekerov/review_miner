{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great boutique hotel", "text": "Recently stayed at 60 Thompson for business and pleasure. It is well located in Soho and my room was more than adequate. Dinner at the hotel's restaurant was delicious and provided great people watching. I found the staff throughout the hotel to be quite friendly and helpful. The only reason I did not rate this as an &quot;Excellent&quot; hotel is that it has no business center at all. Also, my room did not have a tub. Between the Soho Grand and 60 Thompson, I would choose whichever hotel gives you a better price; they are both great hotels.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-28"}

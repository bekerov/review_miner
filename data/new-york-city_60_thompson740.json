{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Glamorous boutique hotel great service top location", "text": "You can spend a lot of money on a hotel that cliams to be an unber cool boutique hotel in downtown manhattan and be very disappointed. Whilst 60 Thompson is not cheap, you do get good value. We booked ahead of time and got a deal on a room that was much bigger than the normal shoe box you get in major cities. The decor is very cool and up to the minute. Big bathroom with delicious products. Great food from room service. Impeccable service from the staff. The big selling point in the summer is the stunning roof terrace bar which is very comfortable, intimate and has amazing views of the manhattan skyline. The hotel is in a fantatstic location a couple of blocks from broadway in the heart of the lively SoHo district.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-16"}

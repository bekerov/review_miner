{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "centrally located hotel!", "text": "we stayed at the Andrews Hotel in September 2005 and had a nice stay. Since we paid only 370 euro for 4 nights, I was a little curious what the hotel would be like, but it turned out to be just fine. Room was a little crampy and if you are over 6 ft tall the shower is a bit on the short side, but the pastries for breakfast were fresh and an absolut delight combined with the lovely coffee and tea. The hotel is near Union Square and a 10 minute walk from Powell BART station and near the cable car turn. The perfect hotel if sleeping is the most important thing to do at your hotel!!", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-10-04"}

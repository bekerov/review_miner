{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "I had the best ime!", "text": "Well, what can I say that would express how I think about the Hotel 414? I think, &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;perfect&quot; would be the right terms to describe, what I experienced during my one-week-stay in April.Not just that the Hotel is very nice and the rooms are so big, most impressive was how friendly the whole staff was. I really have to say thank you especially to Greg, who was there for us all the time during our stay and answered all our questions. The 414 would not be the same without him!The Hotel lies is a very quiet street and the only thing you can hear in the morning are the birds, that are sitting in the patio. After a wonderful night in a more than comfortable bed you can enjoy the delicious breakfast.All the rooms are very clean and have an attractive design, so that you can feel &quot;at home&quot; from the first time you step into the room. I can highly recommend this hotel, even if it is not one of the low priced hotels. But it is worth every cent!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-21"}

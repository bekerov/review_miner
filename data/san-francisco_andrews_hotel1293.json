{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Clean ", "text": "We were very pleased with our stay at this charming hotel. Very clean. The staff was great and the quirky character of the old building reminded us of hotels in London. The location was great-- within walking distance of Union Square and Chinatown. That does mean a certain amount of street noise, so bring your earplugs! I would give it an &quot;excellent&quot;, except for two things: the breakfast was only so-so and the $28/night parking fee, although typical for San Francisco, seems outrageous!", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-06"}

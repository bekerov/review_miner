{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "my new favorite hotel in NYC", "text": "Yes, the rooms are small. but really is that much different than most other rooms in nyc? The pros of this hotel are great - (location to CP, subway, CNN mall, wholefoods, starbucks, great price from website) - but what really makes this place great is the staff. Every staff I've encountered (this was now my second time here) goes out of there way to be friendly, helpful and to remember you by name and preferences. I'll be back again on my next biz trip to NYC!!", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-19"}

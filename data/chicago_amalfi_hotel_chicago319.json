{"city": "chicago", "title": "Excellent stay at Amalfi", "text": "Hotel is great, it is within walking distance to so many activities. It only has six floors so if you are looking for an amazing view of the city, this isn't the hotel for you. What it lacks in view it makes up for with everything else.... The staff is so helpful and friendly, we felt like guests. We haven't been treated that way in years. They go out of their way to say hello and make sure you are happy. Each morning we had a USA Today hanging on our door.The bed in the rooms are so comfortable, I didn't miss my own at home! Remember to bring your ipod, they have an iHome that you can use. They have a makeup mirror and hair dryer in the bathroom. The bathrooms are stocked daily with Aveda products and if you choose to have the key to the minibar, which is also stocked daily.It was refreshing to have breakfast available on your floor that you can just run down and grab something to take back to your room. Coupled with the happy hour in the evening, it was nice to enjoy drinks and great food without putting a hurt on the wallet. Our room was close to the lounge where the happy hour was, once we were in our room, we couldn't hear a peep.We look forward to coming back to this hotel again and cannot say enough how much we enjoyed staying there.Based on another review, we ventured over to Rockit Bar and Grill - fabulous. It was a great recommendation, wonderful food and service.Taxi from the airport will run you between $40 -$45. If you choose the airport shuttle (not affiliated with the hotel), roundtrip is $36 per person. You make your return reservation the day before, but we didn't anticipate them making multiple stops, so if you're not in a rush, this service is pretty convenient.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-02-20"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Location - but that's it", "text": "I stayed at the Allerton on a last-minute business trip. Every hotel in the area was booked solid. For some reason, the Allerton had several rooms available. I arrived very late, 11:30 p.m. to be exact, due to a series of unfortunate events at Chicago O' Hare. Check in took a ridiculously long time. The layout of the hotel is odd - you have to use a series of elevators to get from one area to the next, all of which have strange angles and are tiny. So I got up to my room on the 16th floor and it had not been cleaned at all since the previous occupant had left. The bed was unmade, towels on the floor, the window was open. I dragged my luggage (never saw a bellman) back to the third floor where check-in was and was given a second room, on the 20th floor. My room was larger and seemed nice. On second look there were crackers on the floor by the bed as well as some spare change. There were about 20 little bugs having a party on the ceiling, and the safe - which I didn't touch started beeping the second I got out of the shower. Did I mention that room service closed at 11:00, so no dinner for me. The blanket on the bed was stained with some chocolately looking residue. The room was dirty. I did complain and someone came and picked up the crackers and stopped the safe from beeping. I think the hotel is simply too large for the staff to handle. I wouldn't stay there again.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-07-19"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great time at the Andrews", "text": "Really had a great time at the Andrews in September- room nice for the price and we enjoyed the video collection available for free at the front desk (highly suggest watching Escape from Alcatrez after a visit to the island). Location was excellent, very easy to get to the subway and cablecars. The only negative was our decision to eat in the hotel restaraunt our last night- the free wine was good and we really like all the bar staff but skip dnner! It was very blah italian and the service was not good. In a city with such great choices for dinner it was a waste (try the Globe instead, it was amazing).", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-01-03"}

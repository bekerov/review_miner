{"city": "chicago", "title": "NOT impressed. This place is a dump.", "text": "Just got back from a weekend stay at the Allerton. Let me say, the location is great, but that's the end of it. This is the WORST hotel I have stayed in for years. The place is very outdated and the rooms and elevators are too small. WAY TO SMALL. Our room was not available at 3:00 and we were told that they would contact us as soon as one was ready. I recieved no phone call. On top of that, the room was in terrible condition when we did get it. The wallpaper was old and falling off the wall and the window was lined with masking tape. What a major DUMP. Way over priced as well.Go across the street to the OMNI. I will never make this mistake again.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-21"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Adante is my go-to hotel in SF now", "text": "In the past, I have stayed at the San Remo in North Beach, but wanted a place with private bathrooms and that was closer to the BART, without a huge price jump. I was very pleased with the Adante. The front desk staf was very friendly and helpful, there are great restaurants all around (Anjou, Colibri), theater -- you name it. Rooms were clean and always well-made, with hand-painted borders that gave it a warm and quirky touch. Continental breakfast is really not good, but there is a coffeeshop right next door with bagels for $1.50. Wifi in the lobby is free and works great -- if you want connection in the room, bring a wire for your computer. Walk to Powell street BART is easy,m even with luggage (as long as it rolls). Stayed at both the front and back ends of a work trip, and will be back in April!", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-20"}

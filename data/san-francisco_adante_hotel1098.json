{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Not a bad little hotel", "text": "Location was great for the price. Neighborhood wasn't bad, if you're coming from Union Square. I wouldn't recommend walking further down Geary than the hotel, though. We did have a problem with the cable service -- the hotel didn't have an NBC channel, and CBS was horribly scrambled for 4 of the 7 days we were there and the non-manangement hotel staff didn't seem to care. The internet cafe in the hotel was very convenient, and if you bring your laptop you can access the internet from the lobby or your room. If you don't have an ethernet cable, the front desk will loan you one for free. If you arrive before 3pm for check-in, you can do early check-in for $10.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-02-16"}

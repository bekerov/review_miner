{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Unless you're desperate.....", "text": "I booked a room here based upon good reviews in certain guide books and nice looking rooms on the hotel web site.However, on arrival I was shown to a room with a badly stained carpet, rusty taps, peeling paint, broken tv, and a view of a brick wall. This place is a dump and should be shut down.Breakfast and dinner are included in the room rate but unless you want to risk delhi belly then I would advise you to steer well clear.I admit that it's cheap and the free internet access is great but unless you're really desperate don't even think about checking in here!", "hotel": "ansonia_abby_hotel", "year": "2003", "date": "2003-06-21"}

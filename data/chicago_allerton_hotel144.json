{"city": "chicago", "title": "Disappointing", "text": "My first impressions of this hotel were not good. The hotel has long-since sold its ground floor space for retail on the Magnificent Mile, and therefore you enter the hotel via a less-than-impressive small side entrance and have to wait for an elevator to the lobby on the 3rd floor. My suitcases were taken out of the truck of the taxi and I was handed the baggage receipt stubs - at no point was I given a choice about whether or not I wanted or needed assistance!Check-in was a disaster zone. I waited in line for 15 minutes, although people were cutting in and the check-in staff served them and didn't seem to care. Several guests in front of me were having problems checking in and I soon found out why - when I checked in, they mistook me for another guest in spite of having my credit card with my name clearly printed on it. My room was, in my opinion, very small, as was the bed, and only had a shower, no bath tub. After a long flight I had been looking forward to a bath, so this was also disappointing. The decor was dated, and I would not have wanted to stay more than one night. My room faced out onto the Magnificent Mile which, be warned, is very noisy! The Christmas shoppers were making a lot of noise when I arrived, and I was woken up regularly in the night by emergency vehicle sirens. Maybe Chicago needs to impose fines for noise during the night hours as they do in Manhattan?Of course, the proximity to the Magnificent Mile is also an advantage and you are in a great location with this hotel.Overall, I found this hotel disappointing compared to other Crowne Plaza properties and would not stay there again.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-09"}

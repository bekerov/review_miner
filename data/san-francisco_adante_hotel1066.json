{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Great budget hotel", "text": "On my first trip to San Francisco the Adante hotel was both cheap, clean, and in a very convienent location. The rooms were small but very clean and cozy. The contiental breakfast wasn't anything but muffins and coffee, but at least it saved us from buying breakfast for our three day stay. I would reccommend the hotel to anyone looking for a place to stay while vacationing in the city. I don't think that the hotel would be very good for families, but was perfect for my boyfriend and I (a couple in their young twenties). The only advice that I would give is make sure not to take a right turn out of the hotel as the neighborhood gets a bit sketchy, ( we made this mistake but luckily in the daytime, even though it was still very scary!) but as long as you head towards union square you will be fine. Great place for people on a budget looking for a clean and nice hotel!", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-07"}

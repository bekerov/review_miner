{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "we loved it`", "text": "My friend and I stayed here from Nov. 15 to 19/04. The staff was very friendly and helpful booking our city tour and checking things for us on the internet (thank you Asam). Our room was small, but clean and more than adequate and comfortable. The continental breakfast was not much to speak of, but the coffee and orange juice were good and if you like blueberry muffins... that was all they served for the four days we were there. But we really enjoyed getting our coffee in the lobby and then having a bagel next door in the cafe. The location was perfect, 3 blocks from Union Square. There were a few homeless people around our hotel, but you will find them everywhere in this city. And they pretty much leave you alone. For the price we paid ($56) you can't beat the Adante.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-11-22"}

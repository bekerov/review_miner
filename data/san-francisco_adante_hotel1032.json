{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Not again", "text": "We looked at the pictures of this hotel before booking it and thought it is a nice, clean, boutique hotel. When we get there, the lobby was really nice. We were still keeping high hopes. Everything changed when we got into our room. First; there was no air conditioning. We, as a couple, hate air conditioners because it makes both of us sick. However, this room was so hot, we begged for one. So, even if you do not like it, you need it when it is 100 degrees outside. Second bad thing were the towels in the bathroom. They were so old and had so many stains on them that we could not use them. The bed sheets were OK. The rooms are small. The neighborhood is fine if you do not mind homeless people. We only got scared in the night walking back to hotel, as there were so many bad looking people outside. As written in another review, if you exit the hotel and walk right, the neighborhood is pretty scary. Someone even asked us if we need any drugs!", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-21"}

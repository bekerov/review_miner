{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Location and Service", "text": "We have just returned from a 5 night stay at the 414 and could not fault the hotel/B&amp;B for price, location and more importantly the great service provided by Mike and Jessica. Mike will give you all the local knowledge you need! As stated by most reviewers you are right on restaurant row and an easy walk through the theatre district to Times Square so you can not be better placed to enjoy those areas or get uptown or downtown. The room was comfortable, the internet connection in the foyer was partcularly useful, and the bagels and croissants at breakfast were great. We would definitely consider staying here again - a great base to explore Manhattan.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-02-01"}

The visit started shaky when I was not able to present the manager with a Comp Voucher that I didn't realized I needed. Staff stayed calm, let me work through what I needed to do. And then in the end did what they needed to do to help me have a great weekend. Loved the friendliness of the staff. Roof top bar - gorgeous, Thom Bar lots of fun and Kittichai amazing! Highly recommend!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-15"}

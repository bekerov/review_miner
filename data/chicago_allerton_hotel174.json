{"city": "chicago", "title": "Not as bad as other reviews depicted", "text": "I participate in a group meeting each June in the North Michigan Avenue area of Chicago. This June we weren't able to stay at the usual hotel and were booked instead at the Allerton. I had read a number of reviews prior to my stay and was anticipating disappointment. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised at the accomodations and service from the staff. One review recommended asking for an upgrade to a suite which I attempted at check-in. I was told the upgrade would cost an extra $70 per night so I declined. The room I received at the group rate is exactly what I expected with an upgrade! It was relatively large with a sitting area and king sized bed. The only complaint I had with the accomodations is that the bathroom was very small. If I had been staying with someone else in the room I could imagine it being problematic.All-in-all I was delighted with my stay and will remember to read future reviews with &quot;a grain of salt&quot;", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-07-10"}

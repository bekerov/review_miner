{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Hotel in New York City", "text": "I just got back from a three day drip over the long Easter weekend with my ten year old daughter to New York City. We got a great price $149.00 a night and stayed at 70 Park Avenue Hotel. It was a lovely small hotel that looked like it had been recently redone. Our room was a good size for New York with modern but warm decor. The room was spotless clean and the staff was lovely. They had fresh coffee in a cafe off the lobby every morning and served a breakfast buffet every morning. The breakfast was delicious. Every evening they have a wine reception in the lobby. The hotel was in a quiet area but very conveniently located in mid town just 2.5 blocks south of Grand Central Station. My daughter and I felt very safe the whole trip and could easily hop the subway or walk to wherever we wanted to go. I would definitely stay in the hotel again and would recommend it to a friend. The staff was also very friendly to children.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-04-12"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "LOved the Amalfi", "text": "Our experience at the Amalfi was a home run.The check in went very smoothly even though we were early so we had a greater part of the day to tour.The room was very plush and clean with the necessary extras in the bathroom.We enjoyed the morning continental breakfast on each floor each day which you could get in your bathrobe.No, it was not bacon and eggs but for a few days is was great-fruit,coffee ,tea, and all kinds of muffins and pastries.We especially ennjoyedthe complimentary cocktail party each evening. We met some very nice people and enjoyed the conversations with them. Of course the cocktails and the wonderful appetizers were an added welcomed feature.We can not say enough about the hotel and the superb experience we had in the city of Chicago.Cannot wait to go back.Harry Careys restaurant across the street from the hotel was a great find. The steak and atmosphere proved to be another great find.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-09-17"}

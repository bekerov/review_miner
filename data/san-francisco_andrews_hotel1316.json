{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Thumbs up to Andrews!", "text": "I definitely recommend the Andrews Hotel. We had a very pleasant stay there this past weekend. The hotel is 3 blocks from Union Square so its close to all the shopping etc. Initially, we had a suite on the 7th floor facing the street. But it was noisy even late into the night. We could easily hear all the traffic and noisy revelers from the bars etc!! We changed our rooms to something in the middle of floor (room 704) and that was the quietest possible. The staff was very accomodating and helpful. There was no problem with hot water or anything else. Decent breakfast as advertised. Had a decent PInot Grigio and white Zin at Fino (complimentary). We did not eat there but ate at an Indonesian place two doors down from the hotel. That was great food. I think the place is called &quot;the Indonesian Restaurant&quot;. There is also a wine bar almost next to the hotel that a friend recommended. BUt did not get a chance to go there.We will certainly stay at The Andrews Hotel the next time we venture to the City.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-12-01"}

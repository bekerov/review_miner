{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Small but well designed rooms couldn't be more convenient", "text": "I would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a simple, yet quality stay at a hotel in NY for a reasonable price. The decor is modern and pleasing. The rooms are indeed small but well designed with hidden storage spaces, like drawers under the bed. The Fresh bath products are a real plus as is the Blue Ribbon restaurant in the lobby. The location across the street from the Time Warner building and the Columbus Circle subway station is also super convenient. My only complaint - and the reason why I didn't give this place higher marks - was the full sized bed, which was a bit cramped for two adults. I booked the room through Priceline at a great price and specified two people. I'm not sure if it's normal for the hotel to book two people to a room with a full sized bed, but I'd recommend calling the hotel to make sure.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-24"}

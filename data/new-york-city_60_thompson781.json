{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Location", "text": "Great location for Soho, Greenwich, Chelsea area shopping &amp; restaurants. Fun &amp; happening hotel &amp; bar for 20 &amp; 30 something crowd. Cool lobby. However - overpriced, lacked a certain &quot;polish&quot;; AND... we left our room for two hours in the morning of last day to return &amp; find an unmistakable intrusion. Someone had used the restroom (toilet seat up) &amp; stepped into the tub/shower with black soot on their shoes. Several items had been obviously moved in the drawer but nothing taken - to our knowledge. A bit unsettling for two women. Would not return.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-09-30"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Perfect stay at the Amalfi", "text": "I had shopped around quite a bit for our Feb.9-13 stay in Chicago, and I was so glad we settled on the Amalfi. The location was perfect for us, the staff was very helpful and friendly, and the hotel had everything we needed: a great room, free wireless access for our laptop, an ample breakfast spread right down the hall each morning, and a nice cocktail hour in the evenings in their comfortable lounge, which also happened to be on our floor.Thanks to everyone who gave suggestions on the Chicago forum--we had a wonderful time.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-02-18"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Location but small cramped room", "text": "The room was called a petite classic, it was more petite than classic. The check in was confusing, you have to take the elevator to the third floor, and the entrance lobby did not have a sign to this effect.The room was very clean however. The service at the restaurant was not great, on my first trip there the waitress complained to me that her boss was going to report her for some incident. When I asked for a restauraunt seat I was advised instead to try the bar, and the next day when I asked to order certain breakfast items I was told to &quot;have the buffet&quot; instead!So yes a very small clean room, in a perfect location - that much was good, but the service and hotel layout does need some work", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-03-01"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "wouldn't stay again", "text": "Although the room was clean and the bed comfortable, the front desk and guest service was deplorable. Indifference would be the best way to describe it. The clerk could not even bring herself to get up from her desk (in the room adjacent to the front desk) to answer our tourist type questions. The wake up call we did not receive (and thus nearly missed our tour), when I asked what happened was told 'oh ya there was something wrong with the phone'. When I questioned why he didn't just walk up the stairs and knock on the door...he looked at me blankly offering no apology. I guess customer service is not on the priority list. Also, the morning coffee in styrofoam cups made me feel like I was camping. What would it cost to buy 45 mugs (only 22 rooms afterall!). The big one though is we were awaiting a very important call regarding a meeting time and place. We asked constantly if there were any messages for us and were told time and time again 'no'. Upon our return to Canada, imagine our shock when my employer was surprised we didn't make the appointment. He had left two messages with the hotel. When I phoned to tell them this,...yep you guessed it..indifference. Lastly, waiting outside for 20 minutes at 1am...what happened to the 24hr front desk??? We wondered? If you are to....don't go.Stay somewhere where you feel you are valued and taken care of. It was the only bad thing about New York.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-07-24"}

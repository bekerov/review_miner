{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Huge Rooms for NYC ", "text": "I stayed on the third floor and was grateful for the help of the desk person to bring my giant suitcase upstairs. The stairs are skinny and you should watch your step, and the breakfast wasn't interesting, and there were certainly funky things about the room, but what I appreciated was how huge this room was. Certainly big enough to share with a friend and it was close to everything and relatively (for NYC) quiet. You can spend twice the price for something that looks better from the outside, but if you can handle a little funk, this is a great place. There are also some rooms across a courtyard that are newer and may have fewer access problems. Next time I'm there I'll ask about these rooms. There are great restaurants and bakeries a few blocks away. It's a neighborhood place and it felt comfortable walking to the theater and to subways and bus stops.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-17"}

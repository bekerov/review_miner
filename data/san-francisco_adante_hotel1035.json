The situation in the city is great, very close to Union Square.Rooms are not very big, but it is enough. The street is a liitle noisy.Don't expect too much at the breakfast, it is free but just coffe/tea, orange juice, muffins, and bread with marmelade and butter. It was ok for us, but there is many places in the neighborhood to have great ones.It is THE budget hotel in San Francisco.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-03-07"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Outstanding staff good value but be sure to get a renovated room", "text": "We chose the Allerton mostly because of the location and price for a girls' weekend in the Windy City. We drove from Detroit and it was a little frustrating that the hotel policy prohibits guests from using the luggage carts to transport their own luggage, so we had to have a bellman bring our luggage to our room which of course involved shelling out cash for a tip....The staff on check in was efficeint and friendly, but upon arrival in our 6th floor Jr. Suite, we were not happy. The decor was dated and drab, almost dirty, and we were accosted by the most offensive, foul smell...like an overflowing septic tank. Even the bellman wrinkled his nose in disgust.No fear, one call to the front desk and they upgraded us at no charge to a King Suite in a newly renovated room on the 21st floor which was wonderful! Quality linens and amenities, and a spacious, separate living area with great views of the city and no bad smells.Biggest pros of this property are the location, the value and the professional, efficient staff. From the front desk to the restaraunt , to the concierge, the staff were wonderful. But be sure to insist on a renovated room. Having experienced both, my hunch is most of the poor reviews on this site were experienced in the lower floor rooms which have not been renovated yet.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-04"}

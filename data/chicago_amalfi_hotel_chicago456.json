{"city": "chicago", "title": "I enjoyed my stay", "text": "I was pleased with the welcome as my spouse and daughter entered the lobby. My 4 year old daughter was greeted with crayons and a coloring book. The staff were extremely helpful each time we needed assistance. The bathroom had some minor problems but the staff quickly sent a technician to resolve the issue. I enjoyed the evening cocktails and they even have a service contracted for nanny services if wish to attend evening events (My experience some of the eateries downtown did not allow children in the resturant...The nerve)! The breakfast was average (no cereal selection neither hot or cold). Overall it was a very pleasant experience but nightlife requires a babysitter. Enjoy and hope this helps!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-08-20"}

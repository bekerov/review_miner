{"city": "chicago", "title": "great hotel", "text": "unfortunately for us we arrived on the fourth of July at 4pm and our room was not ready as the hotel had been so busy. After travelling for 12 hours we were not very happy so we accepted a room that was inferior to what we had paid for just to get checked in. We could have changed rooms later but as we were there for only 4 days it was just not worth the hassle.Now for the positve!!!! Hotel staff were always friendly and could not do enough to help with any questions we had. The complimentary breakfast was very welcome and taking it back to our room was good as we did not have that much time in Chicago. The cocktails in the evening were fantastic, the bar staff were great and you could have almost anything you wanted to drink. It was a lovely start to the evening. A special thanks has to go to the &quot;heating engineer&quot; or whatever their name is for him. We could not get our aircon right in our room and he really went out of his way to help. Well done Amalfi your people are great.", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-10"}

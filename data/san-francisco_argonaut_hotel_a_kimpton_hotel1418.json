{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Beautiful Hotel Great location.............", "text": "This is a beautiful Hotel. We were very, very comfortable. The rooms were beautiful and clean and quiet.The most disappointing part was the price of parking. $43 per night!!!!!! It is a lot of money when you stay 4 nights and don't use your car. There wasn't any other &quot;safe&quot; options so we had no choice really.Having said that, everyone was fantastic and friendly, except for a female concierge. We needed assistance to book a Baseball game or at least find out about it, and she was more intent on speaking to someone who was trying to sell her something, so we walked off after waiting for about 10 minutes. We returned to the front desk a bit later and the lady there couldn't have been more helpful. She was fantastic.I recommend the wine tasting and the breakfast. Location was fantastic, base of cable cars and close to piers and restaurants......", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-08"}

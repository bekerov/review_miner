{"city": "chicago", "title": "Nice Place good rates but small", "text": "Many reviewers have mentioned the size of the rooms here. They are small, yes, but for me it was neat to be at a place which obviously has some history to it. The rooms are small, because that's the way they built them 80 years ago (or whenever it was built!) The rooms are also very clean and modern looking. I did not have a chance to go to the bar or restaurant, but they seem to be very hip.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-02-24"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Perfect for our purpose", "text": "Stayed at the Allerton Crowne Plaza this past weekend. We got a rate of $116 on Hotwire. Location of the hotel is awesome - - on the corner of Michigan Ave and Huron. Parking is salty, $36 per night, but there aren't many other choices. Our room was small, but fabulous - - everything extremely clean and like new. The only drawback to this hotel is the lack of a pool. If a pool isn't important, you can't beat the value for a Michigan Avenue stay.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-04-11"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Perfect place after venturing through the streets", "text": "I stayed at this place with my girlfriend for three nights. After trying to find a place that would suite our needs for this trip for more than a week I finally came upon the 6 on Columbus. We reserved a Pod Room (due to our limited budget) and were completely happy with it. Upon arriving we were greeted by extremely polite staff. Everybody working for the hotel was friendly and helpful throughout our stay.The room was very clean, nicely designed and comfortable for two people who use it as a place to relax after hitting the streets of New York. In the morning we found coffee and a selection of good tasting baked goods in the lobby. The location of perfect. It is in walking distance to everything in midtown Manhattan right on the SW corner of Central Park. A subway station is across the street. There are several shops and restaurants around. We would stay here anytime again.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-11-02"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Excellent Experience At the Allerton", "text": "Stayed at the Allerton over New Years (12/30-1/2). Booked 3 rooms the day before directly with hotel and got a special rate (stay 3 nights get 20% off entire bill). Be sure to ask for such specials. Got two standard queen rooms and they were very nice. Best to avoid the Petite Standard room as it is smaller and appears that is where some negative reviews came in. Hotel is an old classic building recently renovated. Staff was just fine for us despite some other reviews. Our main room was the Specialty Suite (bigger than Junior Suite) with king bedroom and huge living room with wet bar and foldout sofabed (they had told us it wasn't a foldout but it was and saved us a rollaway at $25 a night). Fantastic view of Michigan Avenue lights. Asked for a minifridge which they delivered immediately but did not work well so we were not charged. Restaurant and bar are pricey as you would expect but OK. ATM in lobby. 5 elevators are small but fast. Bellman was fantastic for luggage and cabs. Very tight with only about 2 parking spots for unloading so a little hectic. Self park a block away for $38 or valet for $51.We left some clothing in the closet after checkout and the staff retrieved it and mailed it to us instead of taking it home as virtually every other hotel has done to us. If you are looking for a hotel with a variety of room types including suites, which are overpriced elsewhere, try the Allerton. We will come back.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-01-05"}

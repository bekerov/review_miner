{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "\"Great place to stay\"", "text": "Great little hotel in Hell's Kitchen. Hundreds of Ethnic restaurants on the doorstep &amp; an easy 10 minute walk to Times Square. Hotel staff are friendly, helpful &amp; knowledgeable, gave good tips to help us get around town. We had a room on the top floor.... up 3 flights of VERY steep stairs! Luckily a staff member carried our suitcases up &amp; down for us. The room was nicely decorated, looked out over the courtyard (which we had specifically requested), the air-co was a bit noisy but efficient &amp; there was a great added bonus of a refrigerator in the room. The bathroom was done up nice in black &amp; white tiling, overheard a complete converstion from our neighbours though....probably via the ventilation system!! The lobby area doubles up as breakfast room &amp; has free internet access but if you want to print anything you have to e-mail it the hotel as an attachment which they will then print for you at a cost of $2 a page. Breakfast was a nice selection of bagels/croissants/cereals/fruit juice/apples/oranges. Just enough to get you on your way. We ate at the Galaxy restaurant on the corner a couple of times. Open 24 hours, all day breakfasts &amp; super fast service. Enjoyed our stay here for 3 nights, felt we got good value for money. Wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone with young kids though or anyone not fit enough to cope with the stairs.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-25"}

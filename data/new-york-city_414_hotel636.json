{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Small Hotel Big Impact", "text": "My mom and I stayed here for a weekend - wasn't sure what to expect given the other reviews, but overall, we were very pleased. The room was bigger than other hotels we've stayed at, clean, nice bathroom, and the fireplace and breakfast in the morning were a definite plus. They allowed us to leave our bags prior to checking in and after checking out (prior to leaving the city) which is something most other hotels would not do for you. Mike at the front desk was incredibly helpful, offering the type of personal service one would definitely not obtain at bigger hotels. The hotel itself is located near many restaurants and is only a few blocks away from Times Square, but far enough to be away from the hustle and bustle of traffic and noise. Overall, we would definitely stay here again and were definitely pleased.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-03-08"}

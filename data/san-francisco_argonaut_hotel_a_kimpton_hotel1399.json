The staff was extremely accomodating and friendly. They remembered my name throughout the duration of my stay and were very helpful. The hotel also offered a free wine &quot;happy hour&quot; each night that was definitely a perk to staying there. Great location, easy to get around from hotel.", "hotel": "argonaut_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-11-03"}

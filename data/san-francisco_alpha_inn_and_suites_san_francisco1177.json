{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Good for price but short on parking space", "text": "We stayed there on april of 2004. This is what we got for 48$us per night: King bed,mini fridge,coffee maker, fog horn noise from the Golden gate bridge, tight space or non-existent parking, and ghetto-like room neighbors. If you think about using the pool, DON'T. They should think about burrying it and putting more parking space over it. It was very dirty. The room was clean but had a strong smell of carpet deodorant floating around, but we vented it out quickly by opening the window. This is a good hotel for the budget-oriented traveller because of the cheap rates and because it's located in a good neighborhood (Cow's Hollow). You could access everything by using public transit, but much easier with a car.. Bring lots of quarters for metered parking when you visit the city!!!", "hotel": "alpha_inn_and_suites_san_francisco", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-04-12"}

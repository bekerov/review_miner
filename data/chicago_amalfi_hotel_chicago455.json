{"city": "chicago", "title": "Amalfi: Website better than the experience.", "text": "The Amalfi Website is exceptional and will persuade those who are deciding between the many options to take a chance on its hip and cool presentation. The truth of the matter is that the Amalfi Website is better than the actual experience. If you are expecting to be blown away by incredible customer service think again. In my two days at the Amalfi I was not called sir one time. The only time during that period that I was called Sir was when I was jogging and walked through the Conrad Hotel to gain access to a mall. In a matter of 2 minutes I was addressed as Sir three times by different employees all while clad in jogging pants and a wrinkled t-shirt. Amalfi employees were nice but not polished. Accomadating, but not exceptional. Cool, but not excellent in service. I have had better service at an Embassy Suite and a residence inn.Room - Beautiful Suite , Comfortable bed, Nice AmenitiesPrice - Good ValueQuiet- Mature Patrons.Overall - A hip, incentive laden, 3 star boutique masquerading as a 4 star luxury hotel", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-08-31"}

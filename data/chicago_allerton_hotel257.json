{"city": "chicago", "title": "Wouldn't stay at this location again", "text": "I must say that I've always had good luck with Crowne Plazas, so I was bewildered when we arrived at the Allerton. There were 9 girls in our party, and we had asked for 2 rooms, stating that we would need a rollaway cot. Upon arrival, they informed us that cots were not allowed in certain rooms, obviously this is something that should have been told to us beforehand. We arrived to the hotel at 11:00 pm and just wanted to get settled in... 60 minutes later our problem was solved, but only after asking for a manager and speaking with him forever. The people at the front desk were EXTREMELY rude and did not make our first impression a good one. However, I will say that the concierge, maid service, bell hops, etc were awesome and we had a great experience with them. If you're looking for a hotel with great customer service, I suggest you look somewhere else.Also, the rooms are not spacious at all.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-11-05"}

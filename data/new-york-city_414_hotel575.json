{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Amazing Little Hotel!", "text": "We couldn't have found a place better than the 414 Inn to stay! Located in a residential neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen, it is within walking distance to nearly everything. We were a few blocks from Times Square, Broadway, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, almost everything! There are plenty of places to eat and shop in the area too!The staff are most helpful, are available 24 hours a day, give great directions, and have great advice for sightseeing and places to eat. The rooms are fabulous (ours was on the 4th floor), extremely comfortable, and always kept clean. My only note to travelers is that if you cannot go up and down stairs, request a first floor room when making your reservation, as the hotel does not have an elevator. Staying at this little bed and breakfast was one of the best decisions of our entire trip and we will, most definitely, return to this hotel if we ever visit NYC again.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-08-14"}

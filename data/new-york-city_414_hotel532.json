With very fond memories, I remembered my trip to new york &amp; my stay at 414 in 2005 . Such hospitality, it was truly a very homely feeling. The rooms are spacious &amp; very contemporary .I enjoyed the bathroom ammenties which were quite comparable to any five star hotel . My job takes me round luxury hotels all the time but this one is truly a star in its own right. Loved the little courtyard ,perfect for an evening setting.Visit the 414, you will enjoy your stay.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-10-12"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Forget the bad reviews great experience!", "text": "The reviews made a bit nervous, I was disapoointed after booking on priceline and seeing that our bid was accepted with the Allerton. Boy was I wrong, the Allerton was in a great location and everything was wonderful from the price of our room to the staff. Our room was huge, we upgraded to suite and it was on the 22nd floor and over looked Michigan Ave! We had a huge sitting area with a couch that pulled out into a single sleeper with tons of window and TV, there was a sperate large bedroom area with two queen beds, a big TV and a ton more windows. The bathroom was huge with a big walk in shower. The staff was more then accomadating and very friendly. I will say that the elevators are small, but there are five of them. In prior reviews people said that they waited long amounts of time for the elevators, I can't say that we had this problem once and we were in and out of our room a lot. Also, there is a starbucks right acorss the street, another added bonus. I would definately stay here again.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-03-19"}

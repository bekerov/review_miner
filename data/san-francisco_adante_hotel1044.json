{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "not so bad", "text": "Had a pleasant 4 nite stay at the Adante and read some very uneven reviews.For the money you know that you should lower your expectations, having said that front desk staff were always courteousand helpful, housekeeping was always on top of things, rooms done everyday and done right. We had the park and room rate and with the transit system in that town you don't need your vechile to get around. If you book a room at the back of the hotel away from the road we found it was quieter. But if people in the next room talk in loud voices early in the morning and late at nite, bang their door closed when they are coming and going, it doesn't really matter. As far as the area is concerned maybe not the best area in San Fran, but you could easily spend two or three times the money and stay in a upscale hotel a block or two away but your still in the same area with the same homeless people it is not just around the Adante! Skip the continental and go to Dotties or the Crepe house.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-09-20"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Cozy Bed ", "text": "Under the recommendation of a friend, I stayed at this adorable bed &amp; breakfast located on a quiet side street off-Broadway, the heart of New York City. From the first day, this place was a wonderful experience as I walked into the reception lobby and was kindly greeted by the hotel manager who shared useful information and helpful advice. I learned that the hotel recently underwent some renovations and in reality it is actually nicer than the pictures shown on the website. If you are looking for a place in New York City that is clean, simple, affordable and friendly - I recommend you check this place out.:)", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-06-18"}

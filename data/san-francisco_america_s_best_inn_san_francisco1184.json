{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "The carpet was soaked in urine", "text": "We booked their &quot;family&quot; suite which essentially consists of two double beds and a sofa. It had a microwave but was disgusting inside. By the time we unloaded everything, all three of our children who can rough it with the best of em looked me straight in the eye and told me they would rather sleep cramped in the car then stay in the room. The room smelled so badly of urine it burned our eyes. When we picked luggage off of the floor it was wet and smelled. When we told the attendant downstairs about the smell, he said he would give us an air freshener. REALLY? My husband insisted he move us but neither of the two other rooms would adequately hold all 5 of us. We checked them out and one of them happened to be up above the original room and the smell of urine was coming through the vents. The third one was one double bed - no way were my children sleeping on the floor when I wasnt confident they were clean. the bed spread in the last one had a large hole in the comforter the size of a dinner plate. We insisted on getting our money back and drove around for over an hour and half trying to find another place. We finally gave up and was headed further up north toward home and stopped in Marin county and stayed at a really really nice place that was truly a suite for only $20 more a night. Our kids were thrilled. We weren't in the heart of San Fran but our stay was 1000% better than it would have been if we had stayed at this hotel.

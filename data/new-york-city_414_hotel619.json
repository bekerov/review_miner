{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Decent but won't stay again", "text": "The 414 Inn. Advantages: the room was quiet; the location was great; the staff was friendly; and the room, at around $200 a night mid-week, was among the more inexpensive options available. Disadvantages: no elevator, no hair dryer, poor television reception, dingy carpet, no soap dish; no fresh air (I could not keep the windows open); no hotel internet connection; poor water pressure in the shower (a light trickle). The furniture was simple but acceptable. I was not impressed with the pastries offered in the continental breakfast &amp; so went across the street to the bakery, which provides a free newspaper with the purchase of one of many delicious muffins available. I wouldn't want to be on an upper floor of this hotel in a fire.Next time I come to Manhattan, I will trade the 414's great location for a better quality room farther from Times Square.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-10-01"}

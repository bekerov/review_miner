{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Perfectly located!", "text": "It's near great affordable hole-in-the-wall restaurants (Dottie's, Shalimar, Chutney), 3 blocks from the cable car, 7 blocks from BART, and buses running past the hotel or a main line 7 blocks away.It's right on the edge of a rundown section of town (Tenderloin) but the street charm is great and the main streets (Geary and Jones) are bustling all the time. You'll find some homeless folks and seediness on side streets but the area is completely safe.The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was adequate--juice, coffee, english muffin, white bread toast, and jam.We hit a warm spell, in November if you can believe it, and so our room was warm with no A/C. However, by keeping the window open and the fan on during the day and evening it was a reasonable temperature. I don't know what it would be like in the summer. Our king bed room (602) with jacuzzi faced the street and there was noise but with the window closed at night we were able to sleep through it. We always take earplugs with us when we travel, though, just in case. It cost us $86 per night (including tax) and we would stay there again if we returned to S.F.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-19"}

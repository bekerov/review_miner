The free breakfast was exactly as it says on the website - juice, toast and muffins.It was easy to get to the Powell Street BART and to Union Square.Yes there are homeless people about on Geary Street but they didn't bother us. If they asked for money and we said no they thanked us anyway and told us to have a nice day.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-15"}

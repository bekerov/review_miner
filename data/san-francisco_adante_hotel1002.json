{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "I can't recommend it for couples or single females.", "text": "I had a king suite at a great rate and it was a large room. It was just a little dingy feeling with sub-premium linens. I was very dissappointed when I walked in but got use to it. Sort of like that Motel 6 feeling. The bathroom was very clean but the furniture was not. The sofa and chairs had stains on them. I had to open the windows at night for cooling but that made the room noisy. I will not stay there again unless I am travelling by myself and can get a very good deal on it. It is a decent location but there are hotels on every corner that look from the outside to be better.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-28"}

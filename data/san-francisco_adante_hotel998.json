{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Beware of the bed bugs!!!!!", "text": "Beware of room 612, after 7 nightsmyself and my partner left with hundreds of nasty bed bug bites (WHICH ARE STILL VISIBLE MORE THAN A MONTH LATER!!).Also heard one customer complaining of mould around her shower and she wasn't able to change rooms. As we were checking out another couple were trying to check in with an expedia reservation but the hotel had no record of this and was full. Nightmare. Didnt see the outcome but did not look good. Suppose this could have been an error with expedia or the hotel.Pros - free internet, decent location, cheap.Cons - No proper air conditioning in rooms, very bad decor, shower designed for people under 4 foot, sticky carpets, BED BUGS.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-17"}

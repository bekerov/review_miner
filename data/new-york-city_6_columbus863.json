{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "High-price...underwhelming.", "text": "After searching for a hotel with a good location in Manhattan for a &quot;reasonable&quot; price I booked at 6 Columbus. Most prices I had seen were upwards of 500/night and they had rooms at $345. I have to say I left feeling really underwhelmed and disappointed for the money I spent. Positives: 1. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. You really are paying here for location. Subway (59th street/columbus circle) right across the street, QNRW (7th Ave) less than 4 blocks away, Less than 1 block from Time Warner Center/Central Park. 2. Cleanliness--housekeeping service was outstanding. Drawbacks/Negatives: 1. LOUD doors that seemed to slam frequently after 1100pm. 2. Many of the staff were nice but it seemed like many were trying so hard to be friendly and helpful that at times I wasn't sure anyone knew what exactly they were doing. 3. SMALL rooms. I upgraded to a queen deluxe (having booked a superior) and it was tiny...with NO view. 4. LOUD water pipes. Anytime anyone used the water to shower the pipes were super loud. 5. LOUD A/C blower...I couldn't hear the TV when the A/C blower was going and especially not when A/C and water pipes were in use next door. 6. LOUD hum from pipes/fans outside window...if you are not lucky enough to get a street/park facing view and are stuck in the back you look out onto pipes from the adjoining buildings.Unless their prices come down or I could get a &quot;deal&quot;--less than $200 per night, I don't think I would stay here again.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-08-21"}

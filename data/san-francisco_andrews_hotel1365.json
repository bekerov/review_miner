{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Where you want to be.", "text": "It's definately where you want to be. Located next to Union Square and a block or two from some very expensive hotels. If you stay at the luxury ones on Nob Hill, you really have to take a cab or a stress test each time you come or go. Get a superior room, as the rooms are quite small. The place is well maintained and very clean, even if a little &quot;thread bare.&quot; Great free continental breakfast and wine hour. The staff is very attentive and friendly- a real find!", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-10-13"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "414 Inn Has it's pros and cons", "text": "We recently spent 3 nights (April 1-4) at the 414 Inn. I can;t say that it was the best or worst place that we ever stayed. On balance, it was average. There are many good points, and some concerns we had. It depends how much you weigh they items to determine how you will feel about this place.PROSLocation. A great location right across from Restaurant Row and many theaters. A quiet street for Manahattan.Price: We paid $189 a night which was much less than other places in the area. Other cheaper places looked more shabby.Room: Nice bed and plasma TV.Lobby: Free internet service.CONSRoom: Shower had little pressure and heat. Not great when you've done a lot walking. Floors were uneven and carpet was older. Notr much light.Common Areas: Stairways were dangerously dark. Lobby area was too small for more than a few guests to have breakfast at the same time.Breakfast: Could have a better selection. Mini-bagels weren't very fresh.Staff: Staff wasn't overly friendly Usually in a small place like this you would expect charm coming from the staff. I have gotten more charm from larger hotels than at this place.All in all not a bad place, but lacks the true amenities of a greatbed and breakfast.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-04-05"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Thanks to Mona", "text": "We were going there for my son's wedding and had a car so the free parking was great. The location was equally great and Mona, the desk clerk, was who my boyfriend talked to on the phone initally, was great. She was helpful with directions, local transportation and maps to help us with our first time in San Francisco. The room was sufficient with a refrigerator and microwave, which we never used as we were close to great resturants. We'd go there again as the price was very affordable.", "hotel": "america_s_best_inn_san_francisco", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-02"}

My experience at the Garland Hotel was rather charming. Sure, its not in the best part of town, but even many other nicer hotels are only 1 block away. I was travellin on a budget and this hotel met all of my needs.The room was comfortable and clean, and although the TV was rather small the hotel staff was polite and made up for it. I would definitely suggest the Garland to other travelers looking to stay in San Francisco without breaking the bank.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_suites_union_square", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-08-18"}

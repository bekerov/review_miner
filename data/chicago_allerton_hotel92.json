{"city": "chicago", "title": "Convenient Location but Tiny Rooms", "text": "I stayed at the Allerton largely because I was attending workshop being held in the hotel and they gave me a great rate, $199 per night vs. $300, and it is conveniently located to the Chicago main drag, Michigan Avenue. While the decor in the main lobby and restaurant area is snazzy and the staff generally nice and helpful, there are a couple of things that are hard to dismiss. First, the elevators are painfully slow. Additionally, the rooms are so tiny and the bed not very comfortable. I had little room for my toiletries in the bathroom, no where to put anything. Thank goodness it was only me in the room, there would be no room for my husband. It's also annoying that they don't provide a coffee maker in room like so many other hotels do today. Luckily, there's a great convenient eaterie just around the corner on Erie at St. Clair called the Corner Bakery Cafe. The redeeming feature is the shower, mine was great, and, again, the location is great.", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-09-23"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Loved this place!", "text": "Were the elevators slow - yes. Is the construction a bit intrusive - yes. HOWEVER, the quality of staff (helpful, friendly, available) and the comfortable room far outweigh the downsides! This hotel is so close to everything it's wonderful. If you want to know where the best breakfast is - just ask Freddy the doorman! If you need to book a car, just ask Bouchaib the concierge! I stayed with my elderly father for 5 days of sightseeing in Chicago and hand on heart, everyone couldn't have been more helpful! If you want to unwind after a crazy day of shopping, have the cheese platter in the bar - fabulous!Thanks everyone.. I will absolutely stay there again!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-19"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great location great staff but a little worn", "text": "We stayed at 60 Thompson for a short Christmas get-away. For Christmas shopping the hotel's location in SoHo cannot be beat. And for seeing all of the Holiday sites uptown, there are several nearby subway stops. As compared to its equivalents uptown, the hotel's SoHo location makes for a more relaxed and quiet stay. The hotel's staff is very accommodating and answered all of our questions. The bellhops, concierge and front desk persons all went above and beyond to be helpful. Really, can't say enough good things about them (but they really should get a vacation once in a while, saw the same faces at all hours many days in a row). That all said, absent a discount, the hotel's price is well beyond what is reasonable for a hotel that has not been recently updated. The carpets are worn and although clean, bear the marks of many, many guests. The one-pipe heating system makes for an almost uncomfortable stay if it's unseasonably warm. And the beds could be a little more plush. However, if you have a good discount, the 60 Thompson is a lovely little hotel for the price.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-27"}

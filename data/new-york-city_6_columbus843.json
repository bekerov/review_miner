{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great New York hotel!", "text": "I have nothing but great things to say about this hotel! It is BEAUTIFUL! The staff are so friendly! We arrived at this hotel at 7 in the morning from an overseas flight, we were not expecting to check in to our room until at least noon, but we thought we would try anyways. Upon arrival...we found that the room we had booked was not available, but the receptionist offered to upgrade us to a junior suite(studio suite?) for an additional $100. I was very glad we did! This room was huge and gorgeous! We had a 600 square foot balcony, no breathtaking view, but what a surprise! The concierge was more than willing to reccommend places for dinner, and get our reservations for us for shows and dinner, as well as call towncars etc! A little tip goes a long way with these people, we even recieved a &quot;WOW!&quot; from one of the guys! After making a complete mess of our room before we went out to dinner, the housekeeping staff came in and reorganized it all! I was not expecting this, as it was 5 pm, and was actually a little bit embarassed by the state of our room! Just one of the things that added to our amazing stay at this hotel!I would definitely stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat!", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-12-05"}

{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Disgusting", "text": "Never stayed in such a dirty, moldy, disgusting place as this. If an earthquake hit the mold and damp crawling up the bathroom would hold this place up!! The towels were so thin it was impossible to dry with them. This place has to be seen to be believed, how health inspectors allow this place to operate is beyond me. Great location but with so many more hotels on Lombard Street I'd advise anyone to stay well away from this one. Our 13 year old suggested that sleeping on the streets might have been a better option. Need I say more!", "hotel": "alpha_inn_and_suites_san_francisco", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-20"}

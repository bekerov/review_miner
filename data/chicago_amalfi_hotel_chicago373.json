We were very pleased to be greeted with the news that &quot;our room was ready&quot;. This was unexpected and truly appreciated as we could freshen up and have a coffee before heading out. The room was nicely decorated. The Ford Theatre was an easy walk and the evening reception was a nice touch, especially the &quot;Amalfitini&quot;. Would definitly recommend the Amalfi!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-21"}

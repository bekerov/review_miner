Towels were tiny and rough to the touch. We had booked this to avoid driving an hour home after a late night event and ended up deciding to drive home anyway. Location is pretty good - very close to the Marina and Cow Hollow, but don't expect anything more than a safe place to crash. Make lots of plans to be out of your room if you decide to stay here. Good news is you'll have plenty of cash left over. :)", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-08-17"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Everything we wanted", "text": "We wanted location more than anything else and this hotel certainly provides that. Only 2 blocks from Times Square and on a really quiet street opposite a church meant it was as quiet as it can be in the middle of Manhattan. The rooms are bigger than average and ours was clean, light and airy. Comfy bed and large TV. The only potential negative I can think of is the lack of an elevator in the hotel and with the top floor being 3 flights of stairs I would advise anyone with mobility problems to make this clear at the time of booking.For anyone on a budget this should be first choice or very close.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-10-15"}

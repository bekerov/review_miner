{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Location Nice Hotel", "text": "Found this hotel mostly by reviews on this website and others, and due to the fact that it had a really nice daily rate compared to other, trendy hotels in NYC. I have lived in NYC but not visited much (and usually stayed with friends and family when I did) and therefore have very little to compare this to with regards to other Manhattan hotels. Overall my wife and I really liked the hotel. The room was very nice, clean, and with a comfortable bed and a nice TV. It was also very small with a view of an airshaft and a tub made for a Hobbit. Having lived in a small place in Manhattan myself this did not bother me much, but I can see someone not used to such cosy quarters having trouble with it. Only other problems were that they kept having laundry delivery problems resulting in not having washcloths for two days... Also give you the Post (the Post??) and the Wall Street Journal is in the lobby; are they also in the Rupert Murdoch empire? To be fair they did offer to send someone out to get me the Times, but it wasn't worth having to tip the same price as the paper. The location is great with easy access to A,C,B,D,1,2,3 trains, Central Park, Midtown, and UWS and the Village. I was really impressed with the bar at Blue Ribbon Sushi (bartenders were awesome) and the food was good. Unfortunately the sushi was inferior to the fried chicken which was great. Go for the alcohol. Overall it was a nice week and a nice hotel. Would definitely stay there again if for no other reason than it is a nice place in a good location.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-01"}

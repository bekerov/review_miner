{"city": "chicago", "title": "Loved the Allerton", "text": "This was my first trip to Chicago, and if it's yours, please make sure you know where to go once you get off the train. It was very hard to find on foot, since we weren't from there, and most of the people we asked were either tourists themselves, or people that lived there, and weren't friendly. After we finally found the hotel, check-in was a breeze. We went to our room on the 12th floor, opened the door, and came to soon realize that claustrophobia was going to be a problem. The room was absolutely tiny. I felt like I was in a closet. You can barely walk around the bed to get around. That's all it was- a bed, a tiny desk and chair, and an armoire. The bathroom looked very spacious, but I would only recommend this room for someone traveling for business by themselves. I was with my husband for our two year anniversary. We went downstairs to see how much a suite was. First of all, I would recommend everyone using priceline.com and bidding for their rooms. We got ours for $60.00 a night. The upgrade to a suite was $60.00 more a night, but trust me, it was worth it. It was very spacious, two tv's, a couch, and a desk. The hotel staff was very friendly, especially the Concierge. Watch out for the maids though. We had to leave the privacy sign on our door the entire time we were in the room because they would just walk in without any notice. I guess they just assumed it was vacant. I would love to go back to this hotel. Everyone was the best and helped us find the easiest ways around Chicago. Will be back again!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-02-22"}

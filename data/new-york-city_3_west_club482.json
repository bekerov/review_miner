{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Location Can't Be Beat", "text": "We recently stayed at the 3 West Club on a Wednesday and Thursday night (June 18-19). I used this hotel as a backup while I was trying to get a cheaper hotel on priceline. As luck would have it, there was no inventory mid-week on priceline for our dates, so we ended up staying here. For some reason, prices for that week appeared higher than usual for NYC. As a result, the 3 West Club was one of the better bargains I could get at $214 per night ($247 w/tax) without a long list of negative reviews and scary stories. We were, however, a little hesitant because there were so few reviews, and we could find no other information about the hotel, even on their website. But, we decided to take a chance.Our flight to NYC was very delayed, so I called the hotel and told them we would be very late. They said not to worry, that they would never give a hotel room away when we had a reservation. We ended up arriving at about 3 AM, and they had a room waiting for us.We had a room overlooking W 51st Street on the seventh floor. If you are a light sleeper, the noise from the street could be a problem. We were so tired each night that it really didn't bother us too much, and I am a light sleeper. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with the room at that price. If you are looking for luxury, services and amenities in a hotel, I don't think this is the place for you. However, if you need a decent, clean room in an excellent location, this is it. The room was not too small, had a good-sized closet, a decent shower, and a flat panel LCD TV with digital cable and tons of channels.At the time we were there, there was scaffolding on the front of the building, but that really didn't bother us - we didn't notice any active work (i.e., noise from construction) going on while we were there. Through the scaffolding, we could see Rockefeller Center across the street and St. Patrick's Cathedral on the corner. The excellent location of this hotel can't be overstated if you are there to visit many of the tourist attractions.In comparison to the other hotels that were available at this price, I think the 3 West Club is a great deal. I would not hesitate to stay there again.", "hotel": "3_west_club", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-07-15"}

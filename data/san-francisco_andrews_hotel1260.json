{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Pleasant Stay - Great Location", "text": "First stay in San Francisco, traveled with my daughter.For those that have stayed in quaint, smaller european hotels, you'll be right at home. The lobby has an few seats as well as coffee, tea, water. The staff is friendly and helpful.The two-twin (bed) rooms were unavailable so we used a corner king. The room was clean, cool, had adequate space and a huge closet. We requested and got a quiet room (quieter for a city-center hotel). The one inconvenience was the placement of the toilet / sink in the bathroom. I could see where this could be a problem for some travelers as they are in close proximity for, err, seating. An ample continental breakfast was included with good pastries and very good coffee and orange juice. Locate off the lobby was a very nice italian restaurant, Fino, and the hotel offers a complimentary glass of wine in the early evening.The location is great, a 5 minute walk to the starting point of the cable car routes to Fisherman's Wharf (Powell/Hyde, Powell/Mason). Also a simular walk to Union Square and many restaurant choices.My wife will be heading to San Francisco next month and I booked her a room at Andrews.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-17"}

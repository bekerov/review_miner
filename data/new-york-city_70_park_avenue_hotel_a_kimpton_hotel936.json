{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great hotel - location service cleanliness", "text": "Five of us stayed at 70 Park Ave recently and were not disappointed with the hotel in anyway. Two of us shared one of the larger King rooms which have a lot more space than the smallest ones. So, if you plan to stay in the hotel for long periods of time, I recommend a larger room. The concierge was very helpful with lunch recommendations, the staff was very courteuous, and the bartender delivered some awesome cocktails.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-07-17"}

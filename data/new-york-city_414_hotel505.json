{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "NY's best kept secret", "text": "This is a long overdue review. I wanted to keep this hotel my little secret, as it is small, affordable and convenient. NY hotels cost a lot of money, and this place is perfect for a business traveler on a budget. The rooms aren't fancy, and you should not expect great service. But if you want a *quiet*, affordable, relatively clean place to stay, then this is it. I can't believe there are quiet hotel rooms in NYC, but if you request a room in the back building, you will certainly sleep soundly.My brother was passing through and missed a late-night flight. He was due to take a train out of Penn Station the next morning. I called the hotel around midnight, and they had one room left. They took great care of him and he was refreshed and ready to go the next morning, with a quick walk to Penn.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-11-06"}

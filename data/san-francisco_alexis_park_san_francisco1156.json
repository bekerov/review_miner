After I was greeted by the staff, I had checked into my room and the cleanliness and the decor of the room was superb. I was later informed that they had recently renovated the motel. The breakfast was limited to coffee, tea, juice, cereal and pastries; however, san francisco had many different cuisines to offer us.", "hotel": "alexis_park_san_francisco", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-01-16"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Great Location Nice Hotel but they need to work on the details", "text": "Here's a free flowing critique....I hate to be negative about it, especially for our great price of $190. night (it was supposed to be $400. and at that price would have been very disappointing), but they need to work on the details. We were not given shamoo bottles after the first day, but on the third (after asking) were given 5 of each. We asked for luggage racks when we arrived (so that we wouldn't have to put our suitcases on the floor), but after the bellman took the tip he didn't return with the goods. I love the details of boutique hotels but there wasn't much here. Though they did have a lot for sale in the room. They should provided complimentary shower caps, sewing kits, something more - it makes such a difference! They do provide cotton balls and qtips, which is nice. An framed art piece was hung half way behind the t.v. cabinet (what's that about!) That's too easy to fix! I'm a designer and that really bothered me. The Frette sheets were brand new, crisp and luxurious. The floor of the shower had a litle bit of black mold, but otherwise the bathroom was lovely. Great idea - towel bars stacked. Hotel is not child friendly, but we knew that already. There were three of us in the room, but they left one brownie on the pillow and we were fighting over it nightly! It's the details that are missing, you know? Otherwise, it is a simple, nicely designed, clean hotel in a great location, oh and I loved the lit candles in the lobby.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2004", "date": "2004-09-20"}

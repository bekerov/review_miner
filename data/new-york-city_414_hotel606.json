{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Did we stay in the same place?", "text": "We live in NYC, actually very near this place, and stayed for two nights because we had guests in town. We thought it would be fun to check in someplace nearby and let them have our apartment to themselves. We spent the rest of their stay not letting them know what a sacrifice we were making.This place was not nearly clean enough (the rug needed a good vacuuming, especially around the edges, the bathroom needed a really good scrub), the furniture was cheap and rickety (the bed was a simple metal frame), the TV reception was lousy, there was a cheap mini-fridge (brown - no attempt to have it blend in with the dreary gray of the rest of the room) just sitting on the floor, tiles were missing in the bathroom, the shower pressure was pathetic, the noise from the hallway (no elevator, and you could hear every step on the stairs) was very loud, the padded headboard was filthy, the heating was inadequate (there was a cheap plug-in heater - scary), I could go on and on. This place is not being maintained properly.And the price? One could say it was cheap by NYC standards ($230 a night!), but we felt very ripped off.Please, be adventurous, and find someplace better than here to stay (and don't be fooled by the lobby, which is much nicer than the rooms).", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-12-22"}

Firest let me say that the concierge Rocks! Raquel and Eric were amazing at setting up a series of events for my partner's birthday celebration. Everything was perfection. The room at 6 Columbus was very large for New York. We booked a Studio Suite which had a balcony almost as big as the room. Everything about 6 Columbus is very cool. The room lighting/linens furniture and bathroom are all top notch. Blue Ribbon Sushi was fatastic too! I would highly recommend this boutique hotel for anyone who likes a little &quot;edgy swank&quot; in the hotels.", "hotel": "6_columbus", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-04-29"}

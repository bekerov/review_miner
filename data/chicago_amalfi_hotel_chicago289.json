{"city": "chicago", "title": "Fantastic hotel and top value", "text": "A fabulous hotel in every aspect. Hotels throw in complimentery breakfasts quite often, but how often do they offer a free bar and food for an hour and a half each night ! Absolutely tremendous value on both counts. This on top of a first class hotel and excellent room. If you want a room with a great view this may not be it, but I can assure you that all the other facilities are top notch and make up for the view. I cannot reccommend this hotel enough. As others have said beds amazing. You even get a free newspaper every morning. Near to everything as well. TIP. Check out, Second City, in Old Town. A comedy place where John Belushi, Mike Myers plus many more started their careers. A great and very, very funny night", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-06"}

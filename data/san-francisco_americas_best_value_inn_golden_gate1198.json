{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Good but anonomous", "text": "This is one of many similar looking motels on Lombard street. It's convenient for the excellent MUNI public transport system, but please don't think you are near the famous &quot;Twisty&quot; bit of Lombard St. That's miles away.The service was good though with both the people I met on the front desk very helpful. Breakfast is machine coffee, machine juice and muffins. Think of it as a snack, not a way to start your day.Parking is first come first served but I never saw it full. I left mine parked there for 3 days to avoid parking fees elsewhere in city.", "hotel": "americas_best_value_inn_golden_gate", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-08-28"}

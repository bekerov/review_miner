{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "Perfect spot", "text": "We booked to stay at the Andrews for two nights via their own website. Our room and bathroom were small but clean and the space was used very well. We were located right next to the fabulous old style elevator. The location is central to everything we needed and wanted and the staff were courteous and helpful. We checked out on our third day but didn't have to leave until 7 that evening. We left our bags at reception and arrived back in time for our shuttle to the airport. The person at reception offered us the use of a top floor bathroom in which to freshen up before our ride to the airport which was most welcome. Unfortunately we never got tot try the breakfasts as they were always gone by the time we got up.If you are the kind of traveller that simply uses their hotel room for sleeping and dressing then I highly recommend the Andrews.", "hotel": "andrews_hotel", "year": "2006", "date": "2006-07-19"}

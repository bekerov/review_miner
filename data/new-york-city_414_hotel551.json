It is not fancy, but it is clean, the bathroom was large and the bed was comfortable. There is also a large flat screen TV in the rooms although it does not get too many channels. The staff was friendly and accommodating and the location is excellent.", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-02-14"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Great Experience!!!", "text": "We had a great stay at this hotel. The staff was friendly, the bed comfy and the most important for me is that it was CLEAN!!!If I had a complaint, it was the room was a bit small. The bed was sandwiched between two walls meaning if two people were on the bed, one had to climb over the first person to get out. Overall a great stay and we loved the hotel and location!!!", "hotel": "allerton_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-07-22"}

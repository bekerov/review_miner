{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Hidden Gem!", "text": "I had booked this place online months earlier, so we didn't know what to expect, but when we stumbled onto our hotel (just off of Times Square and the theater district) we were wonderfully surprised! You would never guess it from the outside, but once in the lobby we were greeted by a roaring fire, hot coffee &amp; free wireless. And we got some juicy NYC secrets from the really sweet employees. But the best part was the amazingly comfortable bed!!! With a quiet room, plasma screen &amp; a noon check out time, we were in NO hurry to leave!! the 414 Hotel has now become our NYC staple!", "hotel": "414_hotel", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-01-17"}

{"city": "chicago", "title": "Very helpful and polite staff", "text": "I have stayed at and recommended this nice little hotel to everyone I know. The Staff at the Amalfi are always polite and helpful. Whenever we asked for something special, it was at our door in no time.The Happy Hour is wonderful. Lots of Italian antipasta and cocktails, including the signature Amalfitini. It's fun meeting and talking with the other guests. A few more chairs would be nice.The rooms have always been spacious and clean. Last year we booked a large suite which accommodated all of us, with room to spare.It's nice that there are CDs provided if you don't bring your own. The views vary, depending on the location of the room. The continental breakfast on every floor is always fresh with baked goods, fruit, juice and coffee/tea. You can just enjoy breakfast in your room and not have to go out first thing in the morning.The location is walking distance to restaurants and entertainment, so no need to drive or take a cab. We love the Amalfi and will continue to stay there whenever we visit Chicago!", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-02-22"}

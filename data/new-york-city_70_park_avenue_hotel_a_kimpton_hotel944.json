{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "What a wonderful find", "text": "We booked 70 Park Avenue, we wanted it to be away from the rush of Times Square. I e-mailed the Hotel in advance as this was a trip for my wife's retirement from her school. We landed at New York at 11am and were at the Hotel at Midday. The reception although not huge was very welcoming. The receptionist who greeted us was Melissa. She was lovely, very welcoming and made us feel at ease immediately and throughout our stay.We had booked a King Premier room. We were surprised but delighted when told we had been upgraded to a suite on the 17th (top) floor. (If you want a bit of luxury, its worth it). Despite our early arrival our room was ready for us.The room was very big with a large bathroom with jacuzzi bath. Best of all, it had a balcony on two sides. One overlooking Park Ave towards Grand Central Station and the other side at the Empire State Building (WOW). Throughout our stay of 4 nights we were made to feel very welcome. Melissa never forgot our name and it was very much more personal than some large hotels in the City. The Manager also took the time, when we asked to view other rooms, to show us.We did not have time to attend the wine evenings, but saw they were very well attended.We went to the Top of the Rock for the first time, brilliant, no real queues and for me better than the Empire State Building.All in all, we had a great time in NYC and stayed at a lovely Hotel, being away from Times Sq was really nice. Grand Central is 5 mins walk and Times Sq 1 stop on the Metro.Would we stay at 70 Park Avenue again? - Without Question", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-05-31"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "So-So in SOHO", "text": "In a city where you can $100 a night for a bunk bed, value for money is always pot luck in New York. Yet we still had high hopes when we decided to splash out on a $500 room at 60 Thompson for our weekend away. Entering the lobby we were greeted by a mysterious smell that seemed to be a mixture of body odour and alcohol that may have wafted in from the hotel bar. At check-in, the staff were extremely friendly, courteous and welcoming as we were informed that due to a number of late check-outs that our room wasn't ready, but a complimentary drink kept us happy during the half hour wait.Our room was a superior queen located on the 3rd floor, which although very clean and well-maintained, was very cosy. It was also not that well insulated as we later found out when the DJ started in the bar directly below us. The heating/cooling problem often mentioned in other reviews was also apparent with a delicate balance being struck with a partially opened window to avoid dehydration.We both sampled from the room service menu throughout the stay and while the food from the in-house restaurant was very nice, we were shocked to find that after adding an 18% gratuity and a $3 delivery charge the bill still had space left for our own tip, something I have never experienced in any other hotel I have visited. After spending $500 per night, we were also surprised that breakfast was an extra and the novelty of a Dean &amp; Deluca stocked minibar certainly wears off when you could walk two blocks to the actual store and pay half the price.60 Thompson is a sleek hotel, in a great SOHO location with very friendly staff, however when it comes to value for money it left a lot to be desired.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-12-16"}

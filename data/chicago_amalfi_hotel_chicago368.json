{"city": "chicago", "title": "The Amalfi - No Fuss", "text": "The Amafli was a pretty hassle-free stay. The location was great, lots of nice restaurants nearby. The rooms were comfortable, soft bed, lots of pillows. Aveda products (shampoo, contitioner, bar and liquid bosdy soap). The towels were pretty rough, though. Magazines were laid out on the desk and changed weekly. The day before checkout we found that the alarm clock had been upgraded to an IPod-compatible model ( I had remarked to my husband the day before that I needed to remember to bring my IPod adapter for future trips and, voila!) The view was pretty nice, but my dh went crazy - you look right across to Marina City, two apartment towers that look like corn cobs. These buildings were featured on the cover of Wilco's album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.Nice stay, no fuss, good location", "hotel": "amalfi_hotel_chicago", "year": "2008", "date": "2008-05-06"}

We paid a rate of $279/night via Quickbook, and got every penny's worth.The front desk staff was bright and friendly...the concierge cheerful and well informed...and the bell staff prompt and efficient.The first 2 days were practically flawless.Our room was just as hip and stylish as you'd expect in a hotel of this flavor...and was roomy by NY standards (just about the size of a 'regular' room in most areas of the country). The bed and linens were outstanding! The bathroom was spacious, clean, and well appointed.We made a quick trip up to the rooftop bar, which was very vibey with a nice view. We didn't eat at the hotel's Thai restaurant, but it was packed nightly with quite a posh crowd.Arguably, the Thompson's best attribute is it's location! We love Soho, and the Thompson is steps away from anything and everything of interest in the area (Noho/Nolita/Greenwich Village/Canal St/Little Italy/Chinatown), yet feels slightly removed from all the hustle and bustle.There was really only one negative in our 60 Thompson experience. On our last morning there, we woke up to an inordinate amount of banging and clanging by the housekeeping staff. This was at about 8:30am. We were annoyed, but it didn't significantly taint our overall experience.60 Thompson has definitely become our Soho headquarters, and we're looking forward to our next stay!", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-08-02"}

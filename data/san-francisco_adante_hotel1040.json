{"city": "san-francisco", "title": "I Agree - It's Fine", "text": "Though it's on the edge of a sketchy area, the Adante is pretty good, considering its place on the hierarchy of hotels. The standard rooms aren't very big, but they're just big enough for two. The bathrooms were renovated - nice and clean. The decor was pretty nice, and so were the linens. The people at the front desk were all nice and helpful. I kinda liked the mural on the wall. And the breakfast was enough to tide you over until lunch. It was a busy weekend (Nike Women's Marathon) and prices were through the roof at many places, so we were happy to stay at the Adante for a fairly reasonable $89 rate. I'd rather pay less, but I also didn't want to pay $300+ for a 3 or 4*.", "hotel": "adante_hotel", "year": "2007", "date": "2007-12-13"}

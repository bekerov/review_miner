{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Very nice space and spot right on Park Ave", "text": "I will return to the 70 Park Avenue Hotel now that I have found it. it's a terrific hotel with small (but NYC typical) rooms that are well laid out and comfortable. With its Kimpton touches, it makes one feel at home quickly. Plus it is away from the tumult of Times Square and only about a ten minute walk across town from Penn Station. It's about four bocks from Grand Central.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-10-12"}

{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Swanky!", "text": "I only stayed at this hotel for one evening but was VERY pleasantly surprised by the experience. I have unpleasantly surprised at some hotels in New York City but this was certainly the exception to the rule. The room was one of the nicest I have ever stayed in. The room was spacious, the bed was very comfortable and very well decorated. There's a large TV and a pleasant room design. This hotel also has a bar (with food) that was a nice surprise. It's within easy walking distance to Grand Central and it's a snap to get a taxi, even in the early morning hours. This was also a great deal and the cheapest place I found on short notice. I've almost paid as much to stay that places that were FAR inferior. I would love to stay here again.", "hotel": "70_park_avenue_hotel_a_kimpton_hotel", "year": "2009", "date": "2009-09-14"}

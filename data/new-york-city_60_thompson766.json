{"city": "new-york-city", "title": "Nice but expensive", "text": "Just got back from a weekend at 60 Thompson. I was quite satisfied with the hotel, but I would not call it a great value. The entrance and lobby are lovely, but the rooms are very small. The sofa and chair look a little comical in such a small space. The location was great. Restaurant Barolo on the same block was fabulous!The concierge was very helpful. If $$ is no concern, I would recommend this.", "hotel": "60_thompson", "year": "2005", "date": "2005-06-13"}
